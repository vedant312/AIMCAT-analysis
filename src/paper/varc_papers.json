That information then crowds out factors that our unconscious mind had pegged as key at the start. Sometimes, the unconscious gets the key factors wrong, as with ethnic stereotyping, but Malcolm Gladwell in his book <i>Blink </i>insists we're better off teaching the brain to screen out these mistakes than dismissing our instincts. There are lots of situations \u2013 particularly at times of high pressure and stress \u2013 when haste does not make waste, when our snap judgments and first impressions offer a much better means of making sense of the world. When we meet someone for the first time, or walk into a house we are thinking of buying, or read the first few sentences of a book, our mind takes about two seconds to jump to a series of conclusions. Well, <i>Blink </i>is about those two seconds, because those instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and important.\n</font></p></span>\n",

Choose the best answer to each question.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>S</strong>ome of the most high-profile findings in social sciences of the past decade do not stand up to replication, a major investigation has found.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe project, which aimed to repeat 21 experiments that had been published in Science or Nature &ndash; science&rsquo;s two preeminent journals &ndash; found that only 13 of the original findings could be reproduced.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe research, which follows similar efforts in psychology and biomedical science, raises fresh concerns over the reliability of the scientific literature. However, the project&rsquo;s leaders say their results do not reflect a &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; in the social sciences.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tProf Brian Nosek, executive director of the Center for Open Science and a professor at the University of Virginia, said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a crisis, it&rsquo;s a reformation. We&rsquo;re in the midst of a dramatic increase in the rigour and transparency of research in the social sciences.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNosek said that, while some previous replication efforts had been viewed with hostility, this effort had been collaborative. Authors from nearly all of the papers under scrutiny engaged with the project to help ensure the repeat experiments were close replicas of the originals &ndash; and several of these scientists published responses that ran alongside the latest paper.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not recriminations about who is a bad researcher or otherwise,&rdquo; said Nosek. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something that has completely changed over the last five years. Replication in 2012 felt like an attack because it was so rare in science at the time. Now it&rsquo;s become normal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFindings that failed to replicate included a study suggesting that viewing a picture of Rodin&rsquo;s sculpture The Thinker led to people reporting weaker religious beliefs (a possible explanation being that analytical thought, as represented by the sculpture, counteracted religious beliefs). The finding that the physical act of washing your hands leads to less muddled thinking (a phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance) also failed the replication test.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s unreplicable, no study is definitive,&rdquo; said Nosek. &ldquo;Science is really a process of uncertainty reduction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn total, the team tried to replicate one main finding from each of the 21 social science papers published in Science or Nature&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThey found evidence to back the original conclusions in 13 of the 21 (62%) studies. But, on average, the sizes of the effects recorded were about 75% as big in the replication studies, despite these using sample sizes that were on average five times as big.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe latest work revealed scientists were also uncannily accurate at predicting which studies would later succeed or fail to replicate.

Instead of searching for the origin of religion in general human urges, psychologists, anthropologists, and neuroscientists focus on the mental machinery activated in acquiring and representing religious concepts. Do people know what their religious concepts are? This may seem an absurd question, but it is in fact an important question in the psychology of religion, and whose true answer is probably in the negative. In most domains of mental activity, only a small part of what goes on in our brains is accessible to conscious inspection. For instance, we constantly produce grammatical sentences in our native tongue with impeccable pronunciation, often without any idea how this is done. Or we perceive the world around us as made up of three-dimensional objects, but we are certainly not aware of the ways in which our visual cortex transforms two retinal images into this rich impression of solid objects out there.\n</font></p></span>\n",

Let me give you an example. One of my friends went for an alumni meeting that was held at the Taj Hotel, Mumbai. He was looking for a parking place and found none. Being a creative person, he came up with an interesting solution. He observed that there were several cars with chauffeurs. So, he noted the registration number of one of those cars and went to the porch. He made an announcement for the car. Obviously, the chauffeur responded and moved out. My friend quickly parked his car in the now vacant space and went for his alumni meeting. I wondered as to what most of us would have done. We would have looked for a vacant parking space. And driven around till we found one. Our perception is that you can&rsquo;t park your car in a space already occupied. In this case, my friend benefited when he did not operate from standard perceptions. </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><b>Extract </b><b>2</b><b>:</b> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The most difficult thing for all of us is to look at anything with a genuinely open mind. That&rsquo;s because all of us compare anything we see with something we know or are familiar with. Very often we also come to conclusions based on past knowledge, experience, education, upbringing, culture, beliefs, assumptions.

In the case of antipsychotics, these chemically diverse drugs affect many of the same strains of gut bacteria.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The researchers noticed too that the strains of bacteria most resistant to the effects of drugs not aimed at them were also those most resistant to antibiotics. ....To check if that was indeed the case, Dr Maier and her colleagues first looked at a particular strain of a common gut bacterium, <i>E</i><i>s</i><i>c</i><i>h</i><i>e</i><i>r</i><i>i</i><i>c</i><i>h</i><i>i</i><i>a</i><i> </i><i>c</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>i</i>, which they knew carried an antibiotic-resistance gene called <i>t</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>C</i>. Bacteria that possess <i>t</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>C</i><i> </i>can make a protein that works as an antibiotic-expulsion pump. The researchers found that <i>E</i><i>.</i><i> </i><i>C</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>i</i><i> </i>carrying <i>t</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>C</i><i> </i>were resistant to the effects of both antibiotic and non-antibiotic drugs, and that <i>E</i><i>.</i><i> </i><i>C</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>i</i><i> </i>engineered to lack it became susceptible to both.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The team then conducted a foray through the genome of <i>E</i><i>.</i><i> </i><i>c</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>i</i>, intended to look at the protective effects of every gene the bug possesses. They bought a library of 4,000 <i>E</i><i>.</i><i> </i><i>C</i><i>o</i><i>l</i><i>i</i><i> </i>strains, each of which was engineered to overproduce the protein encoded in one particular gene, different for each strain. They studied the effects of seven non-antibiotic drugs on each of these strains. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">They found many cases where proteins (and thus genes) which protected bacteria from these seven drugs were ones already known to make them resistant to antibiotics. In sum, their work suggests that bacteria often use similar mechanisms to evade all classes of drugs. These protective mechanisms can be spread by the bacterial habit of trading DNA not only with conspecifics but also with other members of the bacterial domain. The more these resistant organisms spread, the more they add to the pool of resistance genes in all bacteria, raising the odds that these genes will jump to more disease-causing microbes by horizontal gene transfer. That is worrisome. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

As Lewis Carroll famously pointed out, a perfectly objective and faithful representation of the world would literally have to be the same size as the place it depicted. Therefore, mapmakers must make sensible design decisions in order to compress the physical world into a much smaller, flatter depiction. Those decisions inevitably introduce personal biases, however, such as our tendency to place ourselves at the centre of the world. \u201cWe always want to put ourselves on the map,\u201d says Jerry Brotton, a professor of renaissance studies at Queen Mary University London. \u201cMaps address an existential question as much as one that\u2019s about orientation and coordinates.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cWe want to find ourselves on the map, but at the same time, we are also outside of the map, rising above the world and looking down as if we were god,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a transcendental experience.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Which is why, he says, the first thing most new Google Earth users do is to look up their own address. Modern technology enables this exercise in ego, but the tendency itself is nothing new. It dates back to the oldest known world map, a 2,500-year-old cuneiform tablet discovered near Baghdad that puts Babylon at its centre. Mapmakers throughout history adopted a similar bias toward their own homeland, and little seems to have changed since then. Today, American maps still tend to centre on America and Japanese maps on Japan. It\u2019s such an ego-centric approach that the United Nations sought to avoid it when they created their emblem \u2013 a map of the world neutrally centred on the North Pole.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Similarly, maps can overestimate their creators\u2019 geographic worth, or reveal bias against certain places. Africa\u2019s true size, for example, has been chronically downplayed throughout the history of mapmaking, and even now, non-Africans tend to underestimate the size of that truly massive continent \u2013 which is large enough to cover China, the US and much of Europe.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Religious, political and economic agendas also come into play, adulterating a map\u2019s objectivity. The maps of World War II, for example, were incredibly propagandist, depicting \u201cdreadful red bears and red perils,\u201d Brotton says. \u201cThe maps were distorted to tell a political message.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cA map,\u201d he continues, \u201cwill always have an agenda, an argument, a proposal about what the world looks like from a particular perspective.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Even digital maps skew toward the things that their users deem most important. Those areas that the majority sees as unworthy of attention \u2013 poor neighbourhoods like the Orangi shanty town in Karachi, Pakistan, or the Neza-Chalco-Itza slum in Mexico City \u2013 as well as those places that mapmakers do not often go \u2013 war-torn regions, North Korea \u2013 remain grossly undermapped.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This neglect means maps of remote regions can contain errors that go unnoticed for years. Scientists paying a visit to Sandy Island, a speck of land in the Coral Sea near New Caledonia, recently discovered that the island simply did not exist. The \u201cphantom island\u201d had found its way onto Australian maps and Google Earth at least a decade ago, probably due to human error.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

This tendency to generalize from the perceived attributes of a group to the perceived attributes of an individual belonging to that group is called stereotyping. We know that there are negative stereotypes such as: Truck drivers drive recklessly, Americans are materialistic, politicians are corrupt, and management graduates are job-hoppers. However, there are positive stereotypes as well: Bengalis excel in music, Gujaratis have an uncanny sense of business, and management graduates are industrious. Stereotyping is a pervasive perceptual process, and we are all familiar with stereotypes based upon caste, religion, region, age, sex, organizational role, etc. Stereotyping often leads to erroneous impressions and judgements because the perceiver overlooks significant individual differences among the members of a group.

This is not a coincidence, say Torben Iversen of Harvard University and David Soskice of the London School of Economics, in their recent book, \u201cDemocracy and Prosperity\u201d. Rather, they write, in advanced economies, democracy and capitalism tend to reinforce each other\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Economists and political theorists have imagined all sorts of ways capitalist democracies might fail. The oldest is the worry that grasping masses will vote to expropriate the wealth of entrepreneurs and landowners \u2014 and without secure property rights there can be no capitalism. Hayek thought that the governments of the early 20th century, in responding to the concerns of the masses, had over-centralised economic decision-making, a road that led eventually to totalitarianism. \u2026Joseph Schumpeter feared that as firms grew more powerful, they might push a country towards corporatism and clientelism, winning monopoly rights that would generate profits they could share with politicians. Mr Piketty and others say that inequality naturally rises in capitalist countries, and that political power becomes concentrated alongside economic power in an unstable way. Other economists, like Dani Rodrik, have argued that full participation in the global economy forces a country to give up a degree of either national sovereignty or democracy. Lowering barriers to trade means harmonising trade and regulatory policies with other countries, for instance, which reduces each government\u2019s ability to accommodate domestic preferences.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But if capitalism and democracy are such uneasy bedfellows, what explains their long co-existence in the rich world? \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Mr Iversen and Mr Soskice see capitalism and democracy as potentially mutually supporting, with three stabilising pillars. One is a strong government, which constrains the power of large firms and labour unions, and ensures competitive markets. Weaker countries find it harder to resist the short-term expediency of securing power by protecting monopolies. The second is a sizeable middle class, forming a political bloc that shares in the prosperity created by a capitalist economy. A bargain is struck in which the state provides mass higher education on generous terms, while encouraging the development of frontier industries that demand skilled workers. Middle-class households thus reckon that economic growth is likely to benefit them and their children. Rising inequality is not a threat to capitalist democracies \u2026because middle-class voters care little about the poor and do not support broader redistribution that could raise their tax bills.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Providing the education, infrastructure and social safety net that support a prosperous middle class requires substantial tax revenue. For the system to hold, a third pillar is needed: large firms that are not very mobile. ...Though multinationals are adept at shifting production and profits around the world, in a knowledge economy, leading firms cannot break their connections to networks of skilled individuals like those in London, New York or Silicon Valley. Their complex business plans and frontier technologies require the know-how developed and dispersed through these local networks. That increases the power of the state relative to firms, and allows it to tax and spend... \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">All of this leaves plenty to be concerned about, however. It hinges on the middle classes feeling confident about the economy...\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Algorithms are already helping US courts come to some decisions regarding sentencing and parole, drawing on data such as information about recidivism rates, to considerable controversy. There are fears that this can help entrench existing biases against certain groups. But imagine that we\u2019ve reached the point at which feeding all the available evidence into a computer has led to more accurate verdicts than those reached by juries. In such a case, the computer would be able to pool and analyse all data with speed and accuracy and efficiency. Compare how actual juries work, where individuals might have made differing notes about the case, recall different things and, even after hours of deliberations, still have different views of evidence. With the use of AI, these shortcomings would be addressed. But we care about more than simply getting things right. Even if, by using a machine, we get a more accurate answer, there can still be some reason to value the distinctive contribution of having humans serving on juries. Perhaps we want to hand that over to an AI \u2013 but perhaps not.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The bias that humans can display, the tendency to be swayed by emotion, is of course a potential weakness in reaching a verdict. But it has also been the impetus for changes in the law. There are instances of \u2018jury nullification\u2019 where juries have failed to convict, even though the defendant is clearly guilty in terms of a strict application of the law. No matter how good at assessing a machine might be, we\u2019re a long way off developing machines with a finely tuned sense of justice, an eye for the underdog, and the moral backbone to defy the apparatus of the legal system.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the more general idea remains that juries perform the role of an independent source of judgment as a counter to potential vested interests of the most powerful. And note this: the strength of AI \u2013 the pooling of information, the melding of insights \u2013 in the context of the law directly undermines the basic moral principle of independence of juries. A critic might say that we need this independence only because humans are so unreliable: the legal profession alone can\u2019t be left in charge of justice, but an accurate AI would solve the problem and maybe, with the passage of time, we\u2019d get used to the idea, and hand over our justice system to the machines.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But it\u2019s utterly utopian to think that we\u2019ll ever escape the power imbalances and vested interests that are the reason for having juries. There are alternatives to the problem of  miscarriage of justice than handing over justice to the machines, such as a fast, accessible appeals system. Perhaps, in the future, AI might\u00a0<i>a</i><i>s</i><i>s</i><i>i</i><i>s</i><i>t</i>\u00a0juries to come to decisions \u2013 but this is different to envisaging that AI might <i>r</i><i>e</i><i>p</i><i>l</i><i>a</i><i>c</i><i>e</i><i> </i>humans in legal decision making. The law developed as a human political and social system through much struggle. But the use of AI within the law could, over time, help to change this. We need to consider this carefully, in full awareness of the many implications for justice and democracy.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Everything before then is a dark abyss. Psychologists have named this dramatic forgetting \u2018childhood amnesia\u2019. Patricia Bauer of Emory University, a leading expert on memory development says, \u201c[This phenomenon] demands our attention because it\u2019s a paradox: very young children show evidence of memory for events in their lives, yet as adults we have relatively few of these memories.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">For nearly 100 years, psychologists assumed that memories of infancy did not endure because they were never durable in the first place. The late 1980s marked the beginning of a reformation in child psychology. Bauer and other psychologists began to test infant memory by performing a series of actions\u2026and then waiting to see if a child could imitate the actions in the right order, after a delay ranging from minutes to months.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u2026[These experiments] revealed that the memories of children three and younger do in fact persist, albeit with limitations. [In] a 1991 study, researchers discovered that four-and-a-half-year-olds could recall detailed memories from a trip 18 months prior. Around age 6, however, children begin to forget many of these earliest memories. In a 2005 experiment by Bauer and her colleagues, five-and-a-half-year-olds remembered more than 80 percent of experiences they had at age 3, whereas seven-and-a-half-year-olds remembered less than 40 percent.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This work laid bare the contradiction at the heart of childhood amnesia: infants can create and access memories in their first few years of life, yet most of these memories eventually vanish at a rate far beyond the typical forgetting of the past we experience as adults. Maybe, some researchers thought, enduring memories require language or a sense of self, both of which we lack as infants. But although verbal communication and self-awareness undoubtedly strengthen human memories, their absence could not be the whole explanation for childhood amnesia. After all, certain animals that have large and complex brains relative to their body size \u2013\u2013 such as mice and rats \u2013\u2013 but do not have language or, presumably, our level of self-awareness, also lose the memories they make in infancy.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Perhaps, then, the paradox had a more fundamental physical basis that was common to people and other big-brained mammals. Between birth and our early teens, the brain is still laying down some of its fundamental circuitry and thickening its electrical pathways with fatty tissue to make them more conductive. In a massive surge of growth, the brain sprouts innumerable new bridges between neurons. In fact, we have far more links between brain cells in our earliest years than we end up with in adulthood; most are pruned away. All that excess brain mass is the wet clay from which our genes and experiences sculpt a brain to suit its particular environment...\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This adaptability comes with a price. While the brain undergoes this prolonged development outside the womb, the large and complex network of disparate brain regions that collectively create and maintain our memories is still under construction and not as capable of forming memories as it will be in adulthood. Consequently, the long-term memories formed in our first three years of life are the least stable memories we ever make and highly prone to disintegrating as we age.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

But perhaps a bigger surprise is that no consensus exists on why the bike is as stable as it is. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">At the heart of the puzzle is something we\u2019ve all observed. If you push a riderless bicycle, it balances itself, steering automatically to correct for any wobbles, until it slows down and finally falls flat on its side.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There are two theories as to how the bike keeps itself upright. One is the gyroscopic theory, where the spinning wheel provides enough stability to stop the bike from falling. You can try this for yourself if you have a bike handy. Remove a wheel (the front is easier and probably cleaner) and \u2013 holding the axle \u2013 give it a spin. Now, try to twist the wheel by moving the axle. You\u2019ll see it resists you. Now, with the wheel still spinning, crook a finger under one side of that axle, and let go of the other side.

As Jennifer O\u2019Connell in <i>I</i><i>r</i><i>i</i><i>s</i><i>h</i><i> </i><i>T</i><i>i</i><i>m</i><i>e</i><i>s</i>, says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more appropriate symbol of the kind of society we have become.

Even the \u201cselfie artist\u201d is hardly a creation of 2013. Its genesis isn\u2019t in the iPhone, but in the painted portrait: not among the Twitterati, but among the silk-waistcoated dandies of nineteenth-century Paris. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It may seem like a stretch to mention selfie artists like Kim Kardashian or James Franco in the same breath as Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly, but today\u2019s self-creators owe more to d\u2019Aurevilly\u2019s view of the power of public image than you might think. According to him, dandyism was about more than mere sartorial elegance. It was a way of consciously existing in the world. And d\u2019Aurevilly existed more consciously than most. His 1844 hagiography of Beau Brummel, a dandy of another age, doubles as a manifesto: in his eyes, the true dandy evokes surprise, emotion, and passion in others, but remains entirely insensible himself, producing an effect to which he alone remains immune.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Charles Baudelaire goes still further, treating dandyism in his 1863 essay \u201cThe Painter of Modern Life\u201d as \u201ca kind of religion.\u201d Baudelaire sees the ultimate dandy as transcending his humanity \u2013 by choosing and creating his own identity, he remains splendidly aloof, unaffected by others or by the world at large. \u201cIt is the pleasure of causing surprise in others, and the proud satisfaction of never showing any oneself. A dandy may be blas\u00e9, he may even suffer pain, but he will keep smiling, like the Spartan under the bite of the fox.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Baudelaire takes pains to emphasize that the popular trappings of dandyism \u2013 \u201cclothes and material elegance\u201d \u2013 are secondary to the philosophy underpinning them. \u201cFor the perfect dandy these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of his mind\u201d.

Like other venture philanthropists in Silicon Valley, we hunt for projects that are tech-enabled, data-driven, and have an element of informed risk. Before that meeting, we had already identified a few awardees. We had decided to support World Wildlife Fund\u2019s pilot use of unmanned aerial vehicles to stop wildlife poaching and Equal Opportunity Schools\u2019 use of data analytics to identify and move high-performing yet underrepresented students into advanced math and science classes.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But our team was divided on GiveDirectly. We were looking for scalable, disruptive ideas but weren\u2019t convinced this particular leap would be successful. We invited founders Paul Niehaus and Michael Faye to bring their best data and pitch us live.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Paul and Michael started GiveDirectly in 2008 while pursuing advanced degrees in economics at Harvard. Their graduate research had uncovered multiple reports demonstrating the effectiveness of cash transfer as a model to alleviate poverty. They wanted to donate, but couldn\u2019t find a single non-profit using this approach, so they created their own.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Today, GiveDirectly remains the first and only non-profit devoted to unconditional cash transfers directly to the impoverished. Their lean model uses mobile-based banking technology from M-Pesa to transfer 90% of the money raised into the hands of the poor. Just 10% is spent on transfer fees and the cost of locating and enrolling recipients.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Since launching in Kenya, GiveDirectly continues to evaluate its approach with randomized control trials. They compare developmental outcomes of households who have received funding against those who haven\u2019t. Their rigorous data shows that no-strings attached cash transfers improve health and downstream financial gains. They also use this data to refine their model, and make it available on their website.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Recipients, who are often living on less than 65 cents a day, invest in everything from food for starving children to long-term assets, including land, livestock and housing. The data fights conventional wisdom: Money spent on alcohol and cigarettes either decreases, stays constant or increases in the same proportion as total other expenses (approximately 2% to 3%).\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Investments in common goods such as roads, school and wells are critical in helping people out of poverty. But GiveDirectly has a new concept: What if cash transfers are used as a standard benchmark against which to measure all development aid?

Says the narrator of that novel: \"It struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her own natural duties and obligations before she swept the horizon with a telescope in search of others, she would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd \u2026\" \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dickens had no objection to benevolence of the less telescopic, more local and personal sort. He offered sympathetic portrayals of it in Samuel Pickwick and Charles Cheeryble.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Discussions about benevolence, charity, and welfare in Dicken\u2019s time were conducted in the shadow of the great political economist Thomus Malthus, whose 1798 \u2018Essay on the Principle of Population\u2019 and its subsequent revisions were read, not entirely correctly, as arguing for the futility of all large schemes of social improvement. Such schemes, argued Malthus, could only lead to population sizes beyond what the environment could bear, since food supply increases arithmetically, whilst population increase, if not constrained, is geometric.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dickens was anti-Malthusian, or thought he was. The character of Ebenezer Scrooge is generally supposed to be a personification of Malthusianism, and the stonehearted Thomas Gradgrind in \u2018Hard Times\u2019 has actually named one of his children Malthus, presumably for readers who did not take the hint from Gradgrind Sr.\u2019s own forename.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yet Dickens was no more a friend to structural reform than was Malthus. Dickens was, as George Orwell noted regretfully, a bourgeois moralist. The relief of human misery, says Dickens, lies not in social revolution but in a transformation of the individual human heart. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Observation suggests, and rigorous empirical enquiry has confirmed, that the individual human personality is an intractable thing. That leaves us with a choice between Malthusianism and the blithe social optimism Malthus opposed.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">That social optimism was characteristic of the 18<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup><sup> </sup>century Enlightenment. Its emotional inspiration came from universal benevolence; its intellectual foundation was in what David Stove here calls \"externalism,\" to which, he writes \"all Enlightenment thinkers subscribed.\" This was \"their belief that human beings are made what they are by external influences such as education, or the form of government or distribution of wealth prevailing around them\u201d.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Because they are so culturally diverse, no beliefs can be said to be held by all indigenous peoples. However, there are some ideas that are particularly popular among indigenous societies. This makes a lot of sense when you consider the nature of those societies. Primarily, of course, to be indigenous means to be the \u2018first\u2019 peoples of a colonized land. However, indigenous nations and communities often aren\u2019t the very first inhabitants of a land. Many of the Native American nations of the Great Plains were not there first but were pushed onto the plains by the conquerors in the East (and in doing so pushed other nations off the plains). Being indigenous, then, is about more than just being \u2018first\u2019. It is about a connection to the land. Without that connection we would have left our territories long ago, but many of our ancestors consciously stayed and fought their colonizers. In other words, our very identities as indigenous peoples depend on the thoughts and ideas that drive our stubborn devotion to our land.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Soil moisture deficits, brought about by poor rainfall and high temperatures, are a key indicator of drought.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Five of the famines were correlated with significant soil moisture deficits. However, the 1943 famine in Bengal, which killed up to 3 million people, was different, according to the researchers. Though the eastern Indian region was affected by drought for much of the 1940s, conditions were the worst in 1941, years before the most extreme stage of the famine, when newspapers began to publish images of the dying on the streets of Kolkata, then named Calcutta, against the wishes of the colonial British administration. In late 1943, thought to be the peak of the famine, rain levels were above average, said the study published in February in the journal Geophysical Research Letters\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Food supplies to Bengal were reduced in the years preceding 1943 by natural disasters, outbreaks of infections in crops and the fall of Burma \u2013 now Myanmar \u2013 which was a major source of rice imports, into Japanese hands.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen argued in 1981 that there should still have been enough supplies to feed the region, and that the mass deaths in 1943 came about as a combination of wartime inflation, speculative buying and panic hoarding, which together pushed the price of food out of the reach of impoverished Bengalis. More recent studies, including those by the journalist Madhushree Mukerjee, have argued that the famine was exacerbated by the decisions of Winston Churchill\u2019s wartime cabinet in London. Mukerjee has presented evidence the cabinet was warned repeatedly that the exhaustive use of Indian resources for the war effort could result in famine, but it opted to continue exporting rice from India to elsewhere in the empire.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Rice stocks continued to leave India even as London was denying urgent requests from India\u2019s viceroy for more than one million tonnes of emergency wheat supplies in 1942-43. Churchill has been quoted as blaming the famine on the fact that Indians were \u201cbreeding like rabbits\u201d, and asking how, if the shortages were so bad, Mahatma Gandhi was still alive. Mukerjee and others also point to Britain\u2019s \u201cdenial policy\u201d in the region, in which huge supplies of rice and thousands of boats were confiscated from coastal areas of Bengal in order to deny resources to the Japanese army in case of a future invasion\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Though India\u2019s population has vastly increased since the British colonial era, the country has largely eliminated famine deaths owing to more efficient irrigation practices, improvements in seed yields, a stronger food distribution and welfare system and better transport links, which allow emergency food stocks to be moved quickly to deprived areas.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

The idea is that in one future day, humans will be vastly more intelligent, healthy, and physically powerful.

But medical ethicists raise this and other issues as the reason why transhumanism is so dangerous to humans when what is considered acceptable life-enhancement has virtually no checks and balances over who gets a say when we &ldquo;go too far.&rdquo; &hellip; There is, after all, a difference between placing a pacemaker or performing laser eye surgery on the body to prolong human life and lend a greater degree of quality to human life, and that of treating the human body as a tabula rasa upon which to rewrite what is, effectively, the natural course of human life. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A largely intellectual movement whose aim is to transform humanity through the development of a panoply of technologies which ostensibly enhance human intellect, physiology, and the very legal status of what being human means, transhumanism is a social project whose inspiration can be dated back to 19th century continental European philosophy and later through the writings of J. B. S. Haldane, a British scientist and Marxist, who in 1923 delivered a speech at the Heretics Society, an intellectual club at Cambridge University, which foretold the future of the end of coal for power generation in Britain while proposing a network of windmills which would &ldquo;be used for the electrolytic decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen.&quot; According to many transhumanists, this is one of the founding projects of the movement. To read this one might think this was a precursor to the contemporary ecological movement. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The philosophical tenets, academic theories, and institutional practices of transhumanism are well-known. Max More, a British philosopher and leader of the extropian movement claims that transhumanism is the &ldquo;continuation and acceleration of the evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human form and human limitations by means of science and technology, guided by life-promoting principles and values.&rdquo; This very definition, however, is a paradox since the ethos of this movement is to promote life through that which is not life, even by removing pieces of life, to create something billed as meta-life. Indeed, it is clear that transhumanism banks on its own contradiction: that life is deficient as is, yet, can be bettered by prolonging life even to the detriment of life. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">&hellip; In fact, much of the writings on transhumanism take a radical approach to technology: anyone who dares question cutting off healthy limbs to make way for a super-Olympian sportsperson would be called a Luddite, anti-technology. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But that is a false dichotomy since most critics of transhumanism are not against all technology but question the ethics of any technology that interferes with the human rights of humans. </font> </font></span></p>",

We might claim that a narrative has ended; or we might say that a chronicle has ended. This is an important distinction. A narrative has a kind of structure \u2013 for example\u2026a story about how I solved a certain problem; and once the problem was solved, the story ends. A chronicle, by contrast, is just a series of events, with no structure \u2013 the events simply follow one after the other. \u2026A chronicle ends only with the disappearance of the thing we are describing.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">For G W F Hegel, and Danto, art\u2019s narrative had ended; it had progressed as far as it could in solving the task it had set itself. But art\u2019s chronicle would never end: there would be new artworks for just as long as there were human beings to create them. Art\u2019s end, in this sense, was a good thing. Art was released from labouring away at a task (given by the narrative); it was now free to be anything\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">For art to end, then, is for art to be released. Art no longer had to grind away at solving a task. But this still leaves the unanswered question: what does it mean for art to have a task? Hegel\u2019s answer to this question is complex. Its central motor is the claim that human life, including human culture, is underwritten by a collective principle of self-consciousness, known as Geist, a notoriously tricky German term, most often rendered as \u2018mind\u2019 or \u2018spirit\u2019. It is Geist\u2019s task \u2026to refine and complete its awareness of its own freedom, and its awareness of itself. The more this process of refinement progressed, the more abstract and conceptual it became. In the historical period that Hegel roughly identified with Ancient Greece, this self-awareness could find perfect embodiment in \u2018classical art\u2019 ... However, as this self-awareness became more complex and abstract, it developed beyond art\u2019s capacities for expression. Consequently, art could no longer push forward the development of Geist. This task fell to the more discursive and conceptually complex spheres of religion and philosophy \u2026 Art, as a means of eliciting progress in the task of articulating Geist and its self-consciousness, became superseded, and no longer of use in this task.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u2026But the idea that art is perhaps best understood as a practice exhibiting a narrative survives as a genuinely interesting idea\u2026Danto\u2019s claim was that art\u2019s first task \u2013 the first narrative it worked through \u2013 was the perfection of verisimilitude; of producing images that presented an exact likeness of their objects\u2026[However]  the camera obscura was later a key technological advancement, in allowing rudimentary reference photographs to be taken \u2026The camera obscura, of course, soon became the photographic camera, which could record virtually perfect likenesses of objects. Art\u2019s innermost goal \u2013 its narrative of perfecting representations of objects \u2013 had been usurped. It now fell to art, in Danto\u2019s view, to focus on a new question: \u2018What is art?\u2019<b>\n</b></font><b>\n</b></font></p></span>\n",

We might claim that a narrative has ended; or we might say that a chronicle has ended. This is an important distinction. A narrative has a kind of structure \u2013 for example\u2026a story about how I solved a certain problem; and once the problem was solved, the story ends.

Its central motor is the claim that human life, including human culture, is underwritten by a collective principle of self-consciousness, known as Geist, a notoriously tricky German term, most often rendered as \u2018mind\u2019 or \u2018spirit\u2019.

Choose the best answer to each question. \n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">What choices do societies curtail? For most other species, the constraint appears to be that members affiliate with each other and consort little if at all with outsiders. Chimpanzees attack all foreign conspecifics, while the related bonobo can have friends in other communities but always return to their territory at the end of the day. In both instances, there\u2019s a clean separation of the societies, based on the animals\u2019 knowledge of each other.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Human societies come with further obligations. People must look and act appropriately, adhering within accepted limits to whatever differences set us apart from them. [Call] such distinctions markers of identity. These markers, which other primates lack, can include devotion to a particular flag, manners of dress, hairstyles, languages, gestures, moral attitudes, and even slight differences, detected subconsciously, in how we walk and smile. These traits are so numerous and ever-present that human beings are walking billboards for their identities.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">We feel free insofar as our actions and appearance fall within the socially sanctioned bounds of these sometimes-unstated rules [\u2026] The more adversities a society has undergone, the more rigid the expectations put on its people. In a thriving democracy, persons with radical takes retain citizenship, but things can get nasty for those who don\u2019t conform to the required markers when times are tough. Further, the repulsion felt toward social deviants can be so profound that we treat them more harshly for the same offense than we do a foreigner \u2013 an overreaction known in psychology as the \u2018black sheep\u2019 effect. Outliers poorly matching what is \u201cnormal\u201d are ostracized, stigmatized, pressured to change or treated as foreign, depending on the kind and extent of the aberrance. Such censure puts a rein on what goes on in a society.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Extremist regimes aside, by and large citizens everywhere gladly embrace the restrictions placed upon them, believing in the rightness of their society and finding comfort within the restraints it imposes\u2026 The return from the society is substantial: a sense of ease, even camaraderie, around like-minded others; security and social support; access to resources, choices for employment, suitable marriage partners, the arts, and much more.<b>\n</b></font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\u2026Regardless of a society\u2019s permissiveness, unity falters if its citizens have the freedom to act outside the comfort zone of others.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Ethnic diversity presents even greater complications in the pursuit of freedom. ... The difficulty is balancing one group\u2019s pursuit of freedom with another group\u2019s comfort. All too often, inequalities in personal freedom emerge between groups. Minorities must fit in with what the society finds acceptable \u2013 which often means the preferences of the dominant group, which holds primary sway over the identity, symbols, and power of a nation\u2026\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In short, human beings give up a degree of freedom, and to some extent equality, to gain the security and social and economic payoffs of belonging to a nation, with some ethnicities relinquishing more than others. Still, the pleasure that freedom gives us is undeniable. What\u2019s hard is recognizing that dissimilar peoples elsewhere feel the same thing, and for equally good reason\u2026\n</font></p></span>\n",

Choose the best answer to each question.<b>\n</b></font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">Mathematics has been called the language of the universe. Scientists and engineers often speak of the elegance of mathematics when describing physical reality, citing examples such as \u03c0, E=mc<sup>2</sup>, and even something as simple as using abstract integers to count real-world objects. Yet while these examples demonstrate how useful maths can be for us, does it mean that the physical world naturally follows the rules of mathematics as its \"mother tongue,\" and that this mathematics has its own existence that is out there waiting to be discovered? This point of view on the nature of the relationship between mathematics and the physical world is called Platonism, but not everyone agrees with it.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Derek Abbott, Professor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at The University of Adelaide in Australia, has written a perspective piece to be published in the <i>Proceedings </i><i>of </i><i>the </i><i>IEEE </i>in which he argues that mathematical Platonism is an inaccurate view of reality. Instead, he argues for the opposing viewpoint, the non-Platonist notion that mathematics is a product of the human imagination that we tailor to describe reality.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">This argument is not new. In fact, Abbott estimates (through his own experiences, in an admittedly non-scientific survey) that while 80% of mathematicians lean towards a Platonist view, engineers by and large are non-Platonist. Physicists tend to be \"closeted non-Platonists,\" he says, meaning they often appear Platonist in public. But when pressed in private, he says he can \"often extract a non-Platonist confession.\"\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">So if mathematicians, engineers, and physicists can all manage to perform their work despite differences in opinion on this philosophical subject, why does the true nature of mathematics in its relation to the physical world really matter?\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The reason, Abbott says, is that because when you recognize that maths is just a mental construct\u2014just an approximation of reality that has its frailties and limitations and that will break down at some point because perfect mathematical forms do not exist in the physical universe\u2013\u2013then you can see how ineffective maths is.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">And that is Abbott\u2019s main point (and most controversial one): that mathematics is not exceptionally good at describing reality, and definitely not the \"miracle\" that some scientists have marvelled at. Einstein, a mathematical non-Platonist, was one scientist who marvelled at the power of mathematics. He asked, \"How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?\"\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In 1959, the physicist and mathematician Eugene Wigner described this problem as \"the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.\" In response, Abbott\u2019s paper is called \"The Reasonable Ineffectiveness of Mathematics.\" Both viewpoints are based on the non-Platonist idea that math is a human invention. But whereas Wigner and Einstein might be considered mathematical optimists who noticed all the ways that mathematics closely describes reality, Abbott pessimistically points out that these mathematical models almost always fall short.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What exactly does \"effective mathematics\" look like? Abbott explains that effective mathematics provides compact, idealized representations of the inherently noisy physical world. \u2026\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\u201cI argue that there are many more cases where maths is ineffective than when it is effective. Maths only has the illusion of being effective when we focus on the successful examples. But our successful examples perhaps only apply to a tiny portion of all the possible questions we could ask about the universe,\u201d he adds.\n</font></p></span>\n",

The white cells themselves engulf and consume bacteria, but prolonged inflammation also damages host tissue. Both groups of mice were affected, but the effect was more intense in the lectin-deficient animals.

The livers of mice that were given antibiotics which clear their intestines of bacteria before they are dosed with ethanol suffer far less damage than those of similar animals not dosed with antibiotics. Five years ago, that knowledge prompted Dr Schnabl to start looking into the relationship between alcohol and gut bacteria. His latest findings have just been published in <i>Cell </i><i>Host </i><i>and </i><i>Microbe</i>.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Over the course of his research, Dr Schnabl found that heavy consumption of alcohol hampers the intestine\u2019s antibacterial defence system. In particular, it suppresses production of two proteins called REG3B lectin and REG3G lectin. These keep the number of bacteria in the gut under control, so their sudden absence leads to a population explosion. And that, Dr Schnabl hypothesised, lets bacteria escape through the intestinal wall to the liver.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">To test this idea, he designed an experiment. For eight weeks, he and his colleagues fed ethanol both to ordinary mice and to mice genetically engineered to lack the two pertinent lectin molecules. They also engineered some of the rodents\u2019 gut bugs to make the bacteria in question fluoresce. This let them track these bugs and see if any left the intestines.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">They did. As the mice were exposed to more and more alcohol, the glow-in-the-dark bacteria underwent population explosions that let them escape the intestines. Once out, they migrated to the liver, where they triggered strong immune reactions. These drew large numbers of white blood cells into the liver, causing inflammation. The white cells themselves engulf and consume bacteria, but prolonged inflammation also damages host tissue. Both groups of mice were affected, but the effect was more intense in the lectin-deficient animals. In both their livers and their intestines, their bacterial populations were 50% larger than those of the control mice. As a consequence, they ended up with livers that were much more badly damaged.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The researchers then tried things in reverse. They ran the experiment with mice engineered to produce more lectins than normal, and found these animals could endure extensive exposure to alcohol without developing large bacterial populations or showing any signs of liver damage.\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">All this suggests that tinkering with the gut bacteria of alcoholic people might help.  \n</font></p></span>\n",

The cut-glass accent associated with the upper class, emphasized in period dramas like Downton Abbey, has become a little rough around the edges over the last few decades, as more and more people adopt a kind of aristo-cockney hybrid.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The idea of a \u201cproper\u201d accent only emerged fairly recently in the history of the English language. As Jonnie Robinson, a sociolinguist points out, Samuel Johnson chose not to suggest the pronunciation of words in his Dictionary of the English Language, as he felt there was little agreement about the correct way to articulate his terms. \u201cIf you go back to the 18<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> Century, even the gentry, the educated and wealthy would have spoken with something like a local voice,\u201d Robinson says. Doctor Johnson himself was famous for having a Lichfield accent.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It was the increasing popularity of boarding schools that began to change the way the elite spoke, Robinson says, as they began to promote an accent that more closely resembled the sounds of the South East of England (where many of the schools and universities were based). Soon, the accent itself became a marker of class and power that only became exacerbated when the BBC adopted this so-called \u201cReceived Pronunciation\u201d for its first broadcasts. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">By the middle of the 20th Century, the class system itself had become a little more fluid; now, accent was one of the few ways to mark out those who had inherited their wealth from those who had earned it. As the novelist Nancy Mitford ironically expressed: \u201cIt is solely by their language that the upper classes nowadays are distinguished \u2013 since they are neither cleaner, richer, nor better-educated than anybody else.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Perhaps it was only a matter of time before that linguistic divide would begin to close too. As more and more people of working class background have begun to occupy positions of power \u2013 some characteristics of more regional southern English accents have started to creep into the crystal tones of Received Pronunciation (RP). There are now those who speak a more modern form that verges on \u2018estuary\u2019 English, which is a mixture of RP and cockney\u2026.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the past, for instance, RP speakers may have said \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cmoor\u201d with a diphthong \u2013 a combination of two vowel sounds \u2013 so that it sounds something like \u201cpoo-uh\u201d; today, they are more likely to pronounce the words so that they sound identical to \u201cpaw\u201d and \u201cmaw\u201d. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Some younger speakers may even use glottal stops in place of the Ts in phrases such as \u201cit is\u201d or \u201cthat is\u201d\u2026. To Mitford\u2019s ears, these changes would have sounded like Pygmalion in reverse, as if Professor Higgins had taken the season\u2019s debutantes and turned them into cockney flower girls.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

This automatically brought Canada into the war, because of Canada\u2019s legal status as a British dominion which left foreign policy decisions in the hands of the British parliament. However, the Canadian government had the freedom to determine the country\u2019s level of involvement in the war. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Canadians of British descent \u2013 the majority \u2013 gave widespread support arguing that Canadians had a duty to fight on behalf of their Motherland. Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden offered assistance to Great Britain, which was quickly accepted. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) was the designation of the field force created by Canada for service overseas in the First World War. Although the force was raised quickly, it was riven with political patronage and lacked a solid core of professional officers and NCOs. 620,000 men and women volunteered in the war by enlisting as nurses, soldiers and chaplains. In general, non-white people and those born in enemy nations like China, Germany and Japan were not welcomed into the military. During the First World War, the Canadian Army authorized the formation of 260 infantry battalions to serve in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Only a small fraction of these battalions ever reached France to serve on the front lines.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The first Canadian Division of the CEF departed for Great Britain in October 1914. It remained in Great Britain for additional training till February 1915 when it embarked for France. The Canadian Corps was formed from the CEF after the second Canadian Division embarked for France in September 1915. The soldiers of the Corps were mostly volunteers as conscription was not implemented until the end of the war. The Corps was expanded by the addition of the third Canadian Division which formed in France in December 1915 and the fourth Canadian Division which formed in Britain during April 1916 and arrived in France in August 1916. The fifth Canadian Division began assembling in Britain in February 1917, but was broken up in February 1918. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The highpoints of Canadian military achievement during the Great War came during the Ypres, Somme and Vimy battles.  \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The April 1915 battle for Ypres was the site of the first use of poison (chlorine) gas during the war.

The <i>S</i><i>o</i><i>m</i><i>m</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>O</i><i>f</i><i>f</i><i>e</i><i>n</i><i>s</i><i>i</i><i>v</i><i>e</i> had three objectives \u2013 to relieve pressure on the French armies at Verdun, to inflict as heavy losses as possible on the German armies, and to aid allies on other fronts by preventing any further transfer of German troops from the west. The Canadian Corps suffered the highest number of casualties in this battle, but it developed, significant experience in the use of infantry and artillery and in tactical doctrine, preparation and leadership under fire. The Canadian divisions fought separately and then rejoined the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the Battle of Vimy Ridge (April 1917), for the first time, all four Canadian divisions were to be assembled to operate in combat as a Corps. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Canada\u2019s total casualties stood at the end of the war at 67,000 killed and 250,000 wounded, out of an expeditionary force of 620,000 people mobilized. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

They would remember things not because of an internal effort, but by mere virtue of an external device. Writing was dangerous because it decreased the powers of mind by offering human beings a petrified soul, a caricature of mind, a vegetal memory. Nowadays, nobody shares these fears. We know that books are not ways of making somebody else think in our place; on the contrary, they are machines that provoke further thoughts.

Here, however, we immediately encounter a paradox. Although Post-Theorists acknowledge the inner differences in the field of Theory (say, between the early Screen focus on interpellation, Gaze, suture, and the later more historicist-culturalist feminist orientation), they nonetheless emphasise a common Lacanian element as central. They even acknowledge that the only unity of their own project is negative, that of excluding (Lacanian) psychoanalysis &ndash; David Bordwell and Noel Carroll made it clear, in their introduction to the Post-Theory volume, that &lsquo;the unifying principle in this book is that all the research included exemplifies the possibility of scholarship that is not reliant upon the psychoanalytic framework that dominates film academia.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo who are these Lacanians? Post-Theorists like to emphasise that writers of Theory refer to mythical entities like the (capitalised) Gaze, entities to which no empirical, observable facts (like actual cinema viewers and their behaviour) correspond &ndash; one of the essays in the Post-Theory volume actually has the Sherlock Holmesian title &lsquo;Psychoanalytic Film Theory and the Problem of the Missing Spectator&rsquo;. In the same vein, I would like to claim that, in the global field designated by Post-Theorists as that of Theory, we are dealing with a no less mysterious &lsquo;case of the missing Lacanians&rsquo;: except for Joan Copjec, myself and some of my Slovene colleagues, I know of no cinema theorist who effectively accepts Lacan as his or her ultimate background. The authors usually referred to as Lacanians (from Laura Mulvey to Kaja Silverman) as a rule &lsquo;engage with&rsquo; Lacan: they appropriate some Lacanian concepts as the best description of the universe of patriarchal domination, while emphasising that Lacan remained a phallogocentrist who uncritically accepted this universe as the only imaginable framework of our socio-symbolic existence. So, as a Lacanian, I seem to be caught in an unexpected double-bind: I am, as it were, being deprived of what I never possessed, made responsible for something others generated as Lacanian film theory. My response to this is, of course: what if one should finally give Lacan himself a chance? So, to continue in a Maoist vein, I am tempted to determine the opposition between the ambiguous reference to Lacan that has predominated in cinema studies and those who fully endorse Lacan as the second, non-antagonistic contradiction of cinema studies, to be resolved through discussion and self-criticism.</p>",

So, as a Lacanian, I seem to be caught in an unexpected double-bind: I am, as it were, being deprived of what I never possessed, made responsible for something others generated as Lacanian film theory. My response to this is, of course: what if one should finally give Lacan himself a chance? So, to continue in a Maoist vein, I am tempted to determine the opposition between the ambiguous reference to Lacan that has predominated in cinema studies and those who fully endorse Lacan as the second, non-antagonistic contradiction of cinema studies, to be resolved through discussion and self-criticism.</p>",

Their solution: Take God out of the mix and replace him with an \u201cintelligent designer\u201d, add some irrelevant mathematics and fancy biochemical jargon, and lo, you have \u201cintelligent design\u201d, which scientists have dubbed \u201cc</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">reationism in a cheap tuxedo.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the tuxedo is fraying, for intelligent design has been rejected by biologists and judges who recognize it as poorly disguised religion. Nevertheless, its advocates (such as the biologist Michael Behe) persist. Behe admits, (like Darwin), that evolution occurs by natural selection sifting new mutations and that all species are related via common ancestors. However, he claims that the important mutations aren\u2019t random but are installed by an intelligent designer. These designed mutations solve natural selection\u2019s problem: the origin of complex biochemical features. Such features appear to defy Darwinian explanation because, claims Behe, they can\u2019t function until all parts are in place. These \u201cirreducibly complex\u201d systems must have been forged by a designer who made simultaneous changes in several genes. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Scientists, however, quickly spotted the errors in this argument.

These \u201cirreducibly complex\u201d systems must have been forged by a designer who made simultaneous changes in several genes. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Scientists, however, quickly spotted the errors in this argument. They pointed out numerous scenarios and then adduced evidence for systems fitting Behe\u2019s definition of \u201cirreducible complexity\u201d that could evolve in a step-by-step manner, without the intervention of an engineer.     \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Further, Behe claims that biochemical pathways are designed rather than evolved because they\u2019re based on the \u201cpurposeful arrangement of parts.\u201d But which arrangements are those designed with a purpose? <b>T</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>y</b><b>\u2019</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>s</b><b>i</b><b>m</b><b>p</b><b>l</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>p</b><b>a</b><b>t</b><b>h</b><b>w</b><b>a</b><b>y</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>h</b><b>a</b><b>t</b><b> </b><b>B</b><b>e</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>s</b><b>e</b><b>e</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>o</b><b>o</b><b> </b><b>c</b><b>o</b><b>m</b><b>p</b><b>l</b><b>e</b><b>x</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>o</b><b> </b><b>h</b><b>a</b><b>v</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>e</b><b>v</b><b>o</b><b>l</b><b>v</b><b>e</b><b>d</b><b>.</b><b> </b>This is a classic example of begging the question: assuming what you\u2019re supposed to prove (purposefulness). ... \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Perhaps Behe\u2019s most ludicrous claim is this: Evolution within the lowest levels of biological classification (genera and species) might be purely Darwinian, but the origin of higher-level groups (families, orders) requires designed mutations. Yet, as every biologist knows, groupings above the level of species are purely subjective. That is, whether you call a group a family or a genus is arbitrary, depending on the tastes of the scientists who work on that group. \u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Behe\u2019s third attack on evolution is that, even at lower levels, it\u2019s \u201cself-limiting.\u201d  Evolution\u2019s reliance on random mutations and natural selection make the process wind down, preventing further change and requiring the designer to step in. These claims are wrong. Environments change and current functions become outmoded, prompting new evolution. New adaptations can create new niches. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:;size:9999999\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Mutation supposedly acts as a brake on evolution because, argues Behe, most genes that fuel adaptation have been irreparably broken and inactivated by mutations. \u2026 Evolution must eventually grind to a halt. But Behe selectively ignores the large number of adaptive mutations that do not inactivate genes. These include d</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">uplications, in which a gene is accidentally copied twice, with the copies diverging in useful ways (different forms of haemoglobin in primates); changes not in gene function but in how and when a gene is turned on and off (m</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">utations producing lactose tolerance in milk-drinking human populations); \u201cchimeric genes\u201d cobbled together from odd bits of DNA (antifreeze genes in fish blood). \u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Within just 14 years, Adolf Hitler had become German chancellor and was dragging the world back towards the Second World War. The blame, it is often said, lay with the leaders of America, Britain and France, who imposed a vengeful &ldquo;Carthaginian&rdquo; peace on Germany, visiting a punishment that crushed the fragile Weimar Republic. If only Versailles had been more generous, the second world war might never have taken place.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe peacemakers [&hellip;] certainly made mistakes, but they deserve a sympathetic hearing. At the end of the first world war the Allies were not too harsh on Germany. If anything, they were not harsh enough.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCritics of Versailles got their attack in early. Just six months after the treaty was signed John Maynard Keynes published &ldquo;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&rdquo; &hellip; Keynes combined intricate tabulations of German coal consumption [&hellip;] to show that Germany could not afford large reparations, that weakness, vanity and vindictiveness blinded the Allies to German suffering and [the] reparations would poison European relations. &hellip;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet Keynes was protesting too much &ndash; and too soon. He was writing in 1919, two years before the size of the reparations was actually determined. The sums being talked of at Versailles were as much as 16 times bigger than the final bill. The reparations imposed in 1921, in what Germans called the &ldquo;London ultimatum&rdquo;, were large, but not impossibly so. Germany was asked to pay 132bn German marks, but this included 82bn marks in bonds that were never likely to become payable. The remaining 50bn marks &ndash; worth about $12.5bn then &ndash; was less than what Germany itself had earlier offered to pay. It was about 160% of the country&rsquo;s GDP... Moreover, Versailles also gave Germany a &ldquo;peace dividend&rdquo; by limiting its military spending, which was by some calculations, worth about as much as the reparations cost.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNeither did reparations cripple Germany&rsquo;s economy. &hellip; Germany produced 30% more iron and 38% more steel in 1927 than it had in 1913, the previous record. ... [Y]et Germany appeared to struggle. It repeatedly failed to pay its reparations bills on time &ndash; its failure to make coal shipments in January 1923, for instance, was its 34th in 36 months. ... Overall, Weimar Germany ended up paying a total of just 20bn marks. Do the defaults and rescheduled debts prove that Germany had been asked to pay too much in 1921?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn fact, Germany&rsquo;s behaviour had less to do with its capacity to pay than its incentives. Article 234 of the Versailles treaty said that the reparations should be adjusted if Germany could show that it could not afford them. Second, the Weimar government spread the idea that Versailles was fundamentally unjust [insisting] the war had been defensive, a response to the threat from imperial Russia and its ally, France. ... Many believed that they had lost the war only because, in 1918, a cabal of Jews and Socialists had &ldquo;stabbed them in the back&rdquo;. The Allies inadvertently played into this punishment narrative&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVersailles failed chiefly because it was being asked to finish the job that the exhausted Allied armies had left unfinished. Unlike France and Belgium, Germany ended the war with its factories and mines intact. Germans felt undefeated. Upended by the depression and goaded by Hitler, they were ready to take up arms again.</p>",

Our [hunter-gatherer] ancestors have for the most part been &ldquo;fiercely egalitarian&rdquo;, intolerant of any form of inequality [&hellip;] aggressively rejecting efforts to institutionalise them into any form of hierarchy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo, what happened to cause such a profound shift in the human psyche away from egalitarianism? The balance of archaeological, anthropological and genomic data suggests the answer lies in the agricultural revolution, which began roughly 10,000 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t...Hunting and gathering was a low-risk way of making a living. ... Hunter-gatherers considered their environments to be eternally provident, and only ever worked to meet their immediate needs. They never sought to create surpluses nor over-exploited any key resources. Confidence in the sustainability of their environments was unyielding.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn contrast, Neolithic farmers assumed full responsibility for &ldquo;making&rdquo; their environments provident. They depended on a handful of highly sensitive crops or livestock species. When the stars were in alignment &ndash; weather favourable, pests subdued, soils still packed with nutrients &ndash; agriculture was much more productive than hunting and gathering enabling farming populations to grow far more rapidly than hunter-gatherers and sustain these growing populations over much less land.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut successful Neolithic farmers were still tormented by fears of drought, blight, pests, frost and famine. In time, this profound shift in the way societies regarded scarcity also induced fears about raids, wars, strangers &ndash; and eventually, taxes and tyrants. Not that early farmers considered themselves helpless. If they did things right, they could minimise the risks that fed their fears. This meant pleasing capricious gods in the conduct of their day-to-day lives &ndash; but above all, it placed a premium on working hard and creating surpluses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&hellip; The productivity of a patch of land is directly proportional to the amount of energy you put into it. This principle that hard work is a virtue, and its corollary that individual wealth is a reflection of merit, is perhaps the most obvious of the agricultural revolution&rsquo;s many social, economic and cultural legacies.

Choose the best answer to each question. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>O</strong>ne of the great unexplained wonders of human history is that written philosophy first flowered entirely separately in different parts of the globe at more or less the same time. The origins of Indian, Chinese and ancient Greek philosophy, as well as Buddhism, can all be traced back to a period of roughly 300 years, beginning in the 8th century BC.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese early philosophies have shaped the different ways people worship, live and think about the big questions that concern us all. Most people do not consciously articulate the philosophical assumptions they have absorbed and are often not even aware that they have any, but assumptions about the nature of self, ethics, sources of knowledge and the goals of life are deeply embedded in our cultures and frame our thinking without our being aware of them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYet, for all the varied and rich philosophical traditions across the world, the western philosophy I have studied for more than 30 years &ndash; based entirely on canonical western texts &ndash; is presented as the universal philosophy, the ultimate inquiry into human understanding. Comparative philosophy &ndash; study in two or more philosophical traditions &ndash; is left almost entirely to people working in anthropology or cultural studies. This abdication of interest assumes that comparative philosophy might help us to understand the intellectual cultures of India, China or the Muslim world, but not the human condition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis has become something of an embarrassment for me. Until a few years ago, I knew virtually nothing about anything other than western philosophy, a tradition that stretches from the ancient Greeks to the great universities of Europe and the US. Recently and belatedly, I have been exploring the great classical philosophies of the rest of the world, travelling across continents to encounter them first-hand. It has been the most rewarding intellectual journey of my life.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMy philosophical journey has convinced me that we cannot understand ourselves if we do not understand others. Getting to know others requires avoiding the twin dangers of overestimating either how much we have in common or how much divides us. Our shared humanity and the perennial problems of life mean that we can always learn from and identify with the thoughts and practices of others, no matter how alien they might at first appear. At the same time, differences in ways of thinking can be both deep and subtle. If we assume too readily that we can see things from others&rsquo; points of view, we end up seeing them from merely a variation of our own.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo travel around the world&rsquo;s philosophies is an opportunity to challenge the beliefs and ways of thinking we take for granted. By gaining greater knowledge of how others think, we can become less certain of the knowledge we think we have, which is always the first step to greater understanding.</p>",

And while some labour is enjoyable (building a stuffed bear with one&rsquo;s nephew) and some labour allows for product customization (building a bear with one&rsquo;s alma mater&rsquo;s logo) &ndash; both of which might increase valuation &ndash; we suggest that labour alone can be sufficient to induce greater liking for the fruits of one&rsquo;s labour: even constructing a standardized bureau, an arduous, solitary task, can lead people to overvalue their (often poorly constructed) creations.

Because deep ecology is primarily a social and political movement, the advocates of the position do not want to alienate potential supporters with a narrow or technical ideology. Naess has emphasized repeatedly that there are many deep ecology positions and he has used his \u201capron diagram\u201d with its various levels to show that different philosophical and religious positions can be used to derive and justify the platform of the deep ecology movement. To borrow a phrase from the Republican Party in the United States, deep ecology claims to be a \u201cbig tent\u201d within which many different fundamental philosophical perspectives can feel at home.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One way to characterize the central ideas of the philosophy of deep ecology would be to look carefully at the philosophical content of the deep ecology political platform, for the platform represents the central common ground occupied by all advocates of the deep ecology movement. Indeed, Andrew McLaughlin claims that the deep ecology platform is the heart of deep ecology, for deep ecology is \u201can ecocentric movement for radical social change\u201d, and not a theoretical or foundational philosophical system. The platform, as the \u201ccommon ground\u201d of deep ecology, expresses the basic ideas of the position, regardless of the differing paths taken to arrive at, derive, or justify these basic ideas. McLaughlin claims that the \u201cpoint\u201d of the platform \u201cis to define the Deep Ecology movement, create clarity within the Movement, and make clear where real disagreement might exist.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Such music was considered that of the upper class and the sounds coming from the peasant\u2019s homes and markets were lesser versions of these grand orchestras. As time progressed there was a shift. With the birth of radio, television, record players, and electric instruments, the entire idea of music changed.

During the Mozambican Civil War &ndash; which raged from 1977 to 1992 &ndash; 90 percent of the 4,000 elephants at the nation&rsquo;s Gorongosa National Park were killed so that their ivory could be used to exchange for weapons and their meat to feed soldiers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFast forward to the present day and research conducted &hellip; [shows] that around a third of the females from the generation born after the war ended are tuskless &ndash; a trait that appears to have been passed on from the adults who survived the war and are tuskless themselves.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tNormally only around two to four percent of female African elephants would be born without tusks, so this is quite the jump. Dominique D&rsquo;Emille Correia Gon&ccedil;alves, a PhD student from the University of Kent who is part of a team of scientists investigating the findings, told the Daily Mail: &ldquo;Ivory poaching targets big tusked animals, so it removes the &lsquo;big tusk&rsquo; gene out of the population.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe elephant population today is derived from most of the elephants who survived the war, where they were heavily poached for their tusks&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe key explanation is that in Gorongosa National Park, the tuskless elephants were the ones which eluded poaching during the civil war and passed this trait onto many of their daughters&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese tuskless elephants are growing from the survivors of poaching so while we are not talking about evolution yet, we could be talking about the removal of certain genes from the population.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIn addition to the changes in tusk development, Joyce&rsquo;s research also discovered what&rsquo;s described as a &lsquo;culture of aggression&rsquo; amongst the female elephants, which is believed to be due to their need to protect their young during the war.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDominique described the &lsquo;culture of aggression&rsquo; as &lsquo;intriguing&rsquo;, adding: &ldquo;This is a big change, as anecdotal records from people that have been in Gorongosa before the war suggest the family units used to be calm and almost indifferent to people presence.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;Many of the matriarchs and lead females of the family units were alive during the slaughter and saw their families and friends being hunted&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&ldquo;They are survivors and the trauma is still present, which would explain such intolerance to humans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tDespite the wave of [human-influenced] tusklessness in recent decades, elephants missing their tusks are surviving and appear healthy, according to Poole.

At the same time, Smooha outlines that Israel qualifies as a democratic state because Israeli Palestinians have full access to democratic political rights.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Alan Dowty resorts to a \u2018thin\u2019 definition of democracy as first developed by the Nestor of research on modern democracy, Robert Dahl who lists the following democracy prerequisites: Freedom to form and join organizations, freedom of expression, right to vote, eligibility for public office, right of political leaders to compete for support and right of political leaders to compete for votes, alternative sources of information, free and fair elections, and institutions for making government policies depend on votes and other expressions of preference.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As Palestinian Israelis are not excluded from this catalogue, Israel [\u2026] qualifies as a democracy. However, in their critique on Smooha, As\u2019ad Ghanem et al. apply a \u2018thick\u2019 concept of democracy, according to which equality (and consent) is an \u201cessential characteristic of a democracy\u201d. As it is uncontested that Palestinian Israelis are discriminated against by their state, it is unsurprising that, on the basis of this definition of democracy, they conclude that Israel is not a democracy.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The academic discourse on thick versus thin concepts of democracy reflects that, in the end, the term democracy refers to an ideal that can hardly match with reality to its fullest degree\u2026 If the criteria of equality as proposed by Ghanem et al. are applied to the fullest degree, hardly any political system would qualify as a fully-fledged democracy, because most, if not all, political systems discriminate to a certain degree against some social groups\u2026<b>\n</b></font><b>\n</b></font></p></span>\n",

But a dramatic report published by Arts Council England (ACE) in December has raised the spectre of the highbrow novelist as an endangered species \u2013 and started a combative debate about how, if at all, writers should be funded.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The study claims falling book prices, sales and advances mean that literary authors are struggling to make a living from their fiction. In today\u2019s market, selling 3,000 copies of your novel is not unrespectable \u2013 but factor in the average hardback price of \u00a310.12 and the retailer\u2019s 50 per cent cut, and just \u00a315,000 remains to share between publisher, agent and author. No wonder that the percentage of authors earning a full-time living solely from writing dropped from 40 per cent in 2005 to 11.5 per cent in 2013. To avoid novel-writing becoming a pursuit reserved for those with independent means, ACE suggests emergency intervention: direct grants for [published] authors and better funding for independent publishers and other organisations.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Tim Lott scorned these proposals [\u2026] arguing that \u201cliterary\u201d authors must \u201cwrite better books\u201d \u2013 that is, books with strong stories. \u201cMy impression of literary fiction,\u201d Lott wrote, citing Eimear McBride\u2019s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing, \u201cis that it has lost the plot. Literally.\u201d In 2013, McBride won the first Goldsmiths Prize which rewards authors taking the sorts of risks with form and language that Lott so objects to. The prize\u2019s most recent winner, Nicola Barker, believes \u201cwhat Tim probably doesn\u2019t fully appreciate is how the creative milieu, as an organism, works\u201d.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cExperimental novelists and artists provide the ideas that form a cultural plankton for bigger organisms to feast upon,\u201d she continues. \u201cOur ideas gradually filter through to the mainstream.\u201d Barker, however, does not believe that literary fiction is \u201cin crisis\u201d.

According to one account, it is possible that most anyone could be a prodigy, with the right environment\u2026 However, recent research indicates that basic cognitive abilities known to be influenced by genetic factors also play a role in prodigious achievement. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the most extensive study of prodigies to date, the psychologist Joanne Ruthsatz and her colleagues administered a standardized test of intelligence to 18 prodigies \u2013 five in art, eight in music, and five in math. There was a wide range of IQs in the sample, from 100 \u2013 the average for the general population \u2013 to 147 \u2013 well above the usual cutoff for \u201cintellectually gifted.\u201d However, with an average score of 140 (above the 99th percentile), nearly all of the prodigies did extraordinarily well on the tests of working memory. Analogous to the central processing unit of a computer, working memory is a cognitive system responsible for carrying out the mental operations involved in complex tasks such as problem solving and language comprehension...\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Working memory is measured with tests that involve both remembering information for a short period of time and manipulating that information in some way. ... Moreover, this variation is substantially influenced by genetic factors, with estimates of heritability typically around 50%. With an average score of 148, the music prodigies in the Ruthsatz study were especially high in working memory (the average for the math prodigies was 135 and for art prodigies was 132). In fact, all eight of the music prodigies were at or above the 99th percentile, and four were at or above the 99.9th percentile.

We suffer through aversive experiences because of the positive payoff at the end \u2013 the release of fear, anxiety or sadness. But catharsis is a poor theory of the emotions. People neither leave horror movies feeling mellow nor walk out of tragedies feeling giddy. The aggression catharsis hypothesis, which establishes that \u201cventing\u201d aggression by watching media violence or playing violent video games can be a method of reducing aggressive behaviours, is flawed. Although Aristotle used \u2018catharsis\u2019 with relation to violent media (plays and poetry), he did not mean that viewing media violence can purge the viewer of aggressive feelings. Furthermore, he offers several detailed requirements of plot and character for achieving his type of catharsis, and modern media violence does not meet these requirements. The empirical support is also not only lacking, a large empirical base contradicts the catharsis hypothesis. Human neuroscience also contradicts the catharsis hypothesis. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

A number of somatic gene therapy trials have been conducted in recent years, with relatively little success. The problem with this approach is that the body is made up of trillions of cells; for the therapy to be effective, the genetic material of what amounts to millions of cells has to be altered.

Modification of the germ line requires, at least in theory, changing only one set of DNA molecules, those in the fertilized egg, which will eventually undergo division and ramify into a complete human being. While somatic gene therapy changes only the DNA of somatic cells, and therefore affects only the individual who receives the treatment, germ-line changes are passed down to the individual\u2019s offspring.

This arises from several causes. In particular, it is not easy to be deeply versed in the military problems of the period and at the same time to possess considerable knowledge of medieval historical writing, with its peculiar problems of historical criticism. This difficulty can be easily highlighted through a brief survey of the literature on the subject of medieval warfare. More than one army officer has devoted his spare time to the study of military life in bygone ages, but this has yielded few tangible results for the history of the Middle ages. Since their profession has given them no preparation in historical method, most of these military writers have not penetrated to the root of the specialized problem which arises. A notable example is that of H.

These tactics were simple, to be sure, like the weapons of the time, but were quite logical and compatible with the means of warfare then available. Delpech amassed an enormous amount of material, for he studied accounts of the battles of the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, but lacked that historical background and critical faculty which are indispensable to study the art of medieval warfare. He accepted all estimates of the number of troops at their face value, just as they appear in the sources. He described battles without carefully sifting accounts of them, and texts from the period itself were often neglected in favour of later versions. Misled by exaggerated estimates of army strengths, he concluded that tactics were further advanced than they actually were.

Delbr\u00fcck studied military problems in the work of Carl von Clausewitz, the best theoretician on the conduct of war. He wrote a biography of Gneisenau, one of the most brilliant adversaries of Napoleon\u2026 He divided military history into periods in which there were tactical units, and periods in which these units were replaced by individual fighters. A tactical unit is a battle formation in which such discipline prevails that the individuals obey the orders of their commander as one. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">According to Delbr\u00fcck, medieval knights of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries did not form tactical units. They were individual fighters, who put their personal honour, fame and reputation above all else. Thus, the individual fighter was the basis of tactics at that time; combat formations were of less importance and by no means essential, and the theory of any real \u2018art of war\u2019 was excluded.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

The lack of interest generated initially in this extra-ordinary story outside the pages of the Financial Times is itself instructive. If the acronyms of modern financial life are impenetrable, the issues technically complex, the terminology euphemistic and the sums involved unimaginable, this is not accidental: such factors have functioned to enhance the mystique of the \u201cmarket\u201d in whose name these developments occurred, and to obscure its imperfections and asymmetrical opportunities.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yet even as the elements became better understood, the crisis revealed the ability of financial markets to preserve private profits while socializing their liabilities. That socialization occurred on a breathtaking scale. Government bailouts to the financial sector in 2008-09 were so large that they left many countries\u2019 debt/GDP ratios 20 to \n25 percent higher, on average, than they would have otherwise been. The paradox was that while governments were thereby weakened, and in many cases slid into crisis, market participants took the assistance while moving rapidly and successfully to prevent any real regulatory challenge. The politicians denounced the irresponsibility of the bankers but fell short of an effective response. On the contrary, unfettered by a global financial transaction tax or any other significant new regulatory pressures, and helped by money made available by the central banks (so-called quantitative  easing, an extremely crude form of pump priming that represented the only form of stimulus left to an age that no longer believed in planning), the derivatives market at the root of the problem has continued to grow, while the financial sector has pushed ahead with many of the novel and uncollateralized instruments that  contributed to the crisis. Alternately cajoling and threatening, its leaders have shown a much greater capacity for collective action, self-assertion and self-preservation than the leaders of Europe\u2019s states. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If the human needs being served by the euro</font><font style=\"font-family:Calibri;\">\u2014</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">the currency with which the very project of ever closer union has come to be identified</font><font style=\"font-family:Calibri;\">\u2014</font><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">are not primarily those of its citizens, this is not surprising, because they have had less say in the outcome than the bankers. In the war years on Ventotene, finance capital was seen as a force to be controlled and checked, and the speculators were regarded as at least partially responsible for the slump of the 1930s. By contrast, integration through financial liberalization and monetary union has produced wealth that European democracies cannot afford and problems they cannot answer, limiting their power and undermining the credibility of their institutions. No longer the fount either of political liberty or of social welfare, European internationalism has moved a long way from its origins.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

They also found something quite rare: an inscription clearly stating the name the ancient Maya gave the city: Bahlam Jol.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The scientists contacted Alexandre Tokovinine, an expert in Maya writing at the University of Alabama, who recalled an inscribed stone monument discovered in the nearby city of Naranjo that documented a series of successful military campaigns against neighbouring kingdoms\u2026Part of the Naranjo inscription stated on a date reconstructed as May 21, 697, \u201cBahlam Jol burned.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Surprisingly, Bahlam Jol was far from the only city proudly proclaimed in the Naranjo monument to have \u201cburned\u201d. The same thing happened to at least three other cities in the area \u2026 This suggests it is very unlikely that total warfare only emerged about a century later, in the Terminal Classic period.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cBurning cities down appears to have been a common tactic much earlier than previously thought,\u201d says Wahl, \u201cso I think the idea that the emergence of violent warfare towards the end caused the Maya\u2019s demise really needs reconsideration.\u201d He is currently investigating the role the climate may have played. While corn production appears to have been severely decreased after the large fire, it only really disappears around 1,000 A.D., when there are strong indications from other studies of widespread regional droughts. This suggests the difficulty to grow food due to a changing climate may have been an important driver of the Maya\u2019s decline even if it didn\u2019t do so by escalating warfare. \u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

The classic scholar starts convinced that the art of Greece has never been equalled or surpassed, and never will be; there are many who think, like Michelangelo, that because Italian painting is good, therefore good painting is Italian. There are many who have never yet felt the beauty of Egyptian sculpture or Chinese or Indian painting or music: that they have also the hardihood to deny their beauty, however, proves nothing. The eighteenth century had forgotten the beauty of Gothic sculpture and primitive Italian painting, and the memory of their beauty was only restored by a great effort in the course of the nineteenth.

Masuda (1980), for example, stresses individualism and the increasing ability of citizens to control their own environments and to find information and education on issues of specialized interest conveniently and inexpensively\u2026 It is an intriguing utopian vision, for it would allow the individual to return to the self-reliance and individualism of the small town and villages of the eighteenth century, but with all the technical trappings and material wealth of the twentieth century.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Huntington (1974) is less sanguine. He is concerned that the politics of postindustrial society may strain the capacities of the political institutions that evolved in earlier times. He worries, for example, that \u201cthe mass media make it possible for \u2018magnetic and attractive personalities\u2019 to command the attention and mobilize the support of \u2018millions of unorganized citizens.\u2019 On the one hand, the citizen is drawn into politics; on the other, his feeling of impotence and the futility of politics escalate.\u201d As in the case of the transition from agricultural life to industrial society, he posits that the changes may occur too fast and in too disconnected a manner for political institutions to adjust. When that happens, just as in the earlier age, each group acts in its own interest with its own weapons.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you, you are aware of only a small area around you,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in most of our cities there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment, and there can be very rich natural choruses to pay attention to. And that is being lost.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The warning came as other scientists reported beneficial health effects from listening to natural sounds. Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In one experiment, Taff told participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a one-way mirror. Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech, found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds from road traffic, aeroplanes, and even normal conversation.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cWe know that natural sounds are very important to people. So, they visit protected areas to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,\u201d Taff said. \u201cWe may be losing this as people are listening to the iPods all the time, but I do believe that the public is appreciative of these sounds. My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Why natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear, but Fristrup speculates that over millions of years of evolution, our brains may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety. \u201cI suspect there\u2019s something about these intact soundscapes that reminds our ancestral brains of a place that\u2019s safe, where there\u2019s no sense of a predator nearby, and that these more cluttered soundscapes are problematic for us because we know we\u2019ve lost that surveillance capability,\u201d he said.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Love it or leave it.

To indulge incorrect ones, meanwhile, is to encourage relativism, vulgar populism, and the dumbing down of literate culture. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Descriptivists, according to this scheme, believe that norms of correctness are arbitrary shibboleths of the ruling class, designed to keep the masses in their place. Language is an organic product of human creativity, and the people should be given the freedom to write however they please. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The thoughtful, nondichotomous position on language depends on a simple insight: Rules of proper usage are tacit conventions. Conventions are unstated agreements within a community to abide by a single way of doing things &ndash; not because there is any inherent advantage to the choice, but because there is an advantage to everyone making the same choice. Standardized weights and measures, electrical voltages and cables, computer file formats, the Gregorian calendar, and paper currency are familiar examples. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The conventions of written prose represent a similar kind of standardization. Countless idioms, word senses, and grammatical constructions have been coined and circulated by the universe of English speakers, and linguists capture their regularities in the &quot;descriptive rules&quot; - that is, rules that describe how people speak and understand. A subset of these conventions has become accepted by a virtual community of literate speakers for use in nationwide forums such as government, journalism, literature, business and academia. These are &quot;prescriptive rules&quot; &ndash; rules that prescribe how one ought to speak and write in these forums. Examples include the rules that govern agreement and punctuation as well as fine semantic distinctions between such word pairs as <i>m</i><i>i</i><i>l</i><i>i</i><i>t</i><i>a</i><i>t</i><i>e</i> and <i>m</i><i>i</i><i>t</i><i>i</i><i>g</i><i>a</i><i>t</i><i>e</i> or <i>c</i><i>r</i><i>e</i><i>d</i><i>i</i><i>b</i><i>l</i><i>e</i> and <i>c</i><i>r</i><i>e</i><i>d</i><i>u</i><i>l</i><i>o</i><i>u</i><i>s</i>. Having such rules is desirable &ndash; indeed, indispensable &ndash; in many arenas of writing. They lubricate comprehension, reduce misunderstanding, provide a stable platform for the development of style and grace, and credibly signal that a writer has exercised care in crafting a passage. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Once you understand that prescriptive rules are conventions, most of the &lsquo;&ndash; iptivist&rsquo; controversies evaporate. One such controversy springs from the commonplace among linguists that most nonstandard forms are in no way lazy, illogical, or inferior. The choice of &lsquo;isn&#39;t&rsquo; over &lsquo;ain&#39;t&rsquo;, &lsquo;dragged&rsquo; over &lsquo;drug&rsquo;, and &lsquo;can&#39;t get any&rsquo; over &lsquo;can&#39;t get no&rsquo; did not emerge from a weighing of their inherent merits, but from the historical accident that the first member of each pair was used in the dialect spoken around London when the written language became standardized. If history had unfolded differently, today&#39;s correct forms could have been incorrect and vice-versa. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the valid observation that there is nothing inherently wrong with &lsquo;ait&rsquo; should not be confused with the invalid inference that &lsquo;ain&#39;t&rsquo; is one of the conventions of standard English. Dichotomizers have difficultly grasping this point, so I&#39;ll repeat it with an analogy. In the United Kingdom, everyone drives on the left, and there is nothing sinister, gauche, or socialist about their choice. Nonetheless there is an excellent reason to encourage a person in the United States to drive on the right: That&#39;s the way it&#39;s done around here. </font> </font></span></p>",

But the authors of a study published on Friday said that even when they analysed the most conservative extinction rates, the rate at which vertebrates were being lost forever was far higher than in the last five mass extinctions.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Previous studies have warned that the impact of humans taking land for buildings, farming and timber has been to make species extinct at speeds unprecedented in Earth\u2019s 4.5bn-year history. Dr Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico said that his study, co-authored by Paul R Ehrlich who famously warned of the impact of humanity\u2019s \u201cpopulation bomb\u201d, employed better knowledge of natural or so-called background extinction rates. He said it was conservative because it looked only at species that had been declared extinct, which due to stringent rules can sometimes take many years after a species has actually gone extinct.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Under a \u201cnatural\u201d rate of extinction, the study said that two species go extinct per 10,000 species per 100 years, rather than the one species that previous work has assumed. Modern rates of extinction were eight to 100 times higher, the authors found. For example, 477 vertebrates have gone extinct since 1900, rather than the nine that would be expected at natural rates.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cIt\u2019s really signalling we\u2019ve entered a sixth extinction and it\u2019s driven by man,\u201d said Ceballos. However, Prof Henrique Miguel Pereira, the chair of the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network, said that the new paper did not add anything revolutionarily new. \u201cThey argue that recent extinction rates are up to 100 times higher than in the past. I think it improves our documentation of the process, but it does not yet confirm a sixth mass extinction. I tend to think we have a major biodiversity crisis, but it would take either a fast acceleration of current extinction rates or a couple of centuries at current extinction rates, for the current process to become a sixth mass extinction.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The team behind the new analysis said \u201crapid, greatly intensified efforts\u201d would be needed to stop or slow the extinctions currently underway. Ceballos pointed to the Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical on the environment, which was published on Thursday and lamented the loss of the world\u2019s biodiversity, and interventions by Barack Obama, as signs of hope. \u201cThese important figures are starting to really grasp the problem,\u201d he said. On why people should be worried about the rate of extinctions, he said: \u201cPeople say that\u2019s really sad, but why does it affect me? There are many reasons we should care. We are the species that are causing the loss of all these other species.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the most important reason, he said, was that by losing species, humanity was losing what enabled us to have a \u201cgood standard of living\u201d.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

When we seek to protect philosophy, we are also protecting our livelihood. There is an irony here, since philosophers often present themselves as thinkers who attain a supreme objectivity in relation to whatever issues they engage with. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The question of our objectivity concerning the significance of philosophy gives us good reason to listen to Bertrand Russell&#39;s views on this subject. ... [Russell&rsquo;s] range and diversity of his work makes him well-placed to comment on the value of philosophy, for he appreciated the relationship between philosophy and other kinds of inquiry. And Russell more than once showed himself to be committed to the pursuit of truth even when this jeopardised his professional life. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">[In his 1946 essay, Philosophy for Laymen,] Russell discusses the nature, purpose and importance of philosophy&hellip; in a set of questions belonging to philosophical inquiry: &quot;Do we survive death in any sense, and if so, do we survive for a time or for ever? Can mind dominate matter, or does matter completely dominate mind, or has each a certain limited independence? Has the universe a purpose? ...If there is a cosmic scheme, has life more importance in it than astronomy would lead us to suppose, or is our emphasis upon life mere parochialism and self-importance?&quot; </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">He continues: &quot;Human life would be impoverished if they were forgotten, or if definite answers were accepted without adequate evidence.&quot; One important purpose of philosophy, therefore, is to keep interest in these questions alive&hellip; </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Socrates argues &hellip; that the philosopher&#39;s pursuit of truth involves reorienting his whole soul towards the good, as well as theoretical clarification of what the soul is and what its good consists in. Russell stands in this tradition, arguing that &quot;if philosophy is to play a serious part [in the lives of men who are not specialists], it must not cease to advocate some way of life&quot;. He identifies key differences between philosophical and religious approaches to living well: philosophy refuses any appeal to the authority of a tradition or a sacred book. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Russell evidently regarded authoritarianism as the essence of religion, and on this basis his philosophy is emphatically anti-religious. An ethically oriented scepticism lies at the heart of his own conception of a properly philosophical way of life. For Russell, philosophy should lead to peace ... &quot;Dogmatism is an enemy to peace, and an insuperable barrier to democracy,&quot; he writes. Even minimal philosophical training, he argues, would teach us to see through the &quot;bloodthirsty nonsense&quot; preached in the name of nationalist, sectarian interests &ndash; and also, in the name of democracy. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Russell teaches his &quot;laymen&quot; readers to think more objectively about emotive issues: &quot;When [in a sentence expressing political opinion] there are words that arouse powerful but different emotions in different readers, try replacing them by symbols, A, B, C, and so on and forgetting the particular significance of the symbols.

For some children, their environment \u2013 growing up in poverty, living with abusive parents, fending for themselves in dangerous neighbourhoods \u2013 can turn them violent and cold-hearted. These kids aren\u2019t born callous and unemotional; many experts suggest that if they\u2019re given a reprieve from their environment, they can be pulled back from psychopathy\u2019s edge.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But other children display callous and unemotional traits even though they are raised by loving parents in safe neighbourhoods. Large studies\u2026have found that this early-onset condition is highly hereditary, hardwired in the brain \u2013 and especially difficult to treat\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">... A trained eye can spot a callous and unemotional child by age 3 or 4. Whereas normally developing children at that age grow agitated when they see other children cry \u2013 and either try to comfort them or bolt the scene \u2013 these kids show a chilly detachment\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As a child gets older, more obvious warning signs appear. Kent Kiehl, a psychologist at the University of New Mexico, says that one scary harbinger occurs when a kid 8-10 years old commits a transgression while alone, without the pressure of peers. This reflects an interior impulse toward harm. Criminal versatility \u2013 committing different types of crimes in different settings \u2013 can also hint at future psychopathy. But the biggest red flag is early violence. \u201cMost of the psychopaths I meet in prison had been in fights with teachers in elementary school or junior high,\u201d Kiehl says\u2026 \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u2026Kiehl and others believe that the psychopathic brain has neural abnormalities \u2013 and that these same differences likely also occur in the brains of callous children.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One of the abnormalities appears in the limbic system, the set of brain structures involved in, among other things, processing emotions. In a psychopath\u2019s brain, this area contains less grey matter. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weaker muscle,\u201d Kiehl says. A psychopath may understand, intellectually, that what he is doing is wrong, but he doesn\u2019t feel it. \u201cPsychopaths know the words but not the music\u201d is how Kiehl describes it...\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In particular, experts point to the amygdala \u2013 a part of the limbic system \u2013 as a physiological culprit for cold-hearted or violent behaviour. Someone with an undersized or underactive amygdala may not be able to feel empathy or refrain from violence. Why does this neural quirk matter? .... [D]istress cues, such as fearful or sad expressions, [are] designed to prevent attacks by raising the white flag; those not sensitive to these cues are more likely to attack somebody whom other people would refrain from attacking.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain hypothalamus is the master clock that controls the internal clocks of different cell types. Microscopic imaging of astrocytes &ndash; star-shaped cells that surround and support neurons of the SCN &ndash; and neurons of the SCN have shown that although both types of cells have their own circadian clocks, they are differently regulated and are seen to be active at different times of the day. This delicate interplay is critical in keeping the entire SCN clockwork ticking. Scientists also found that mice genetically altered to silence their internal body clock showed disruption to their SCN function and behaviour. They now observe that restoration of a genetically functional clock in astrocytes alone enabled the mice to regulate their daily activity. Astrocytes could restart the circadian function of neurons.

By using powerful scanning electron microscopes, she magnified a bee\u2019s microscopic structures by hundreds or even thousands of times in size, revealing startling, abstract forms that are far too small to see with the naked eye. Now, as part of a new project called \u201cTopography of Tears,\u201d she\u2019s using microscopes to give us an unexpected view of another familiar subject: dried human tears.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cI started the project about five years ago, during a period of copious tears, amid lots of change and loss \u2013\u2013 so I had a surplus of raw material,\u201d Fisher says. After the bee project and one in which she\u2019d looked at a fragment of her own hip bone removed during surgery, she\u2019d come to the realization that \u201ceverything we see in our lives is just the tip of the iceberg, visually,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo, I had this moment where I suddenly thought, \u2018I wonder what a tear looks like up close?\u2019\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">When she caught one of her own tears on a slide, dried it, and then peered at it through a standard light microscope, \u201cIt was really interesting. It looked like an aerial view, almost as if I was looking down at a landscape from a plane,\u201d she says. \u201cEventually, I started wondering \u2013\u2013 would a tear of grief look any different than a tear of joy? And how would they compare to, say, an onion tear?\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This idle musing ended up launching a multi-year photography project in which Fisher collected, examined and photographed more than 100 tears from both herself and a handful of other volunteers, including a new-born baby.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Scientifically, tears are divided into three different types, based on their origin. Both tears of grief and joy are psychic tears, triggered by extreme emotions, whether positive or negative.

Emotional tears, for instance, have been found to contain protein-based hormones including the neurotransmitter leucine enkephalin, a natural painkiller that is released when the body is under stress.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Additionally, because the structures seen under the microscope are largely crystallized salt, the circumstances under which the tear dries can lead to radically dissimilar shapes and formations, so two psychic tears with the exact same chemical makeup can look very different, up close. \u201cThere are so many variables \u2013\u2013 there\u2019s the chemistry, the viscosity, the setting, the evaporation rate and the settings of the microscope,\u201d Fisher says.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As Fisher pored over the hundreds of dried tears, she began to see even more ways in which they resembled large-scale landscapes, or as she calls them, \u201caerial views of emotion terrain.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me how the patterns of nature seem so similar, regardless of scale,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can look at patterns of erosion that are etched into earth over thousands of years, and somehow they look very similar to the branched crystalline patterns of a dried tear that took less than a moment to form.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Do ideals, symbols and beliefs lead people to act as they do? Or are the wellsprings of action and the drivers of history less ethereal: money, fear, the thirst for power, circumstance and opportunity, with culture as an afterthought?\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Scholars in the first camp are culturalists; in the second, materialists. And the disagreement between them is not merely academic. It spills over into heated policy debates about crime, poverty, immigration, economic development and everything in between.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In \u201cRule Makers, Rule Breakers,\u201d the psychologist Michele Gelfand sides with the culturalists. ... [She aims to] draw attention to one aspect she believes has been ignored: the social norms \u2014 or the informal rules of conduct, the dos and don\u2019ts, the sources of raised eyebrows \u2014 that emerge whenever people band together.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Gelfand\u2019s thesis is that mapping the tightness or looseness of the cultures of various groups \u2014 nations, regions, social classes, companies, friendship circles \u2014 helps explain things that might otherwise be puzzling. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Take authoritarianism: Why did Egyptians vote overwhelmingly for Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in that country\u2019s 2014 presidential election, choosing to be led by an autocrat just a few years after the democratic hopefulness of the Arab Spring?\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Gelfand argues that whatever a country\u2019s baseline level of constraint (Egypt\u2019s religious conservatism would put it near the tight end of the spectrum), it can adjust in response to shifting conditions. Perceived threats, including social instability, produce tightening. So, it was in Egypt, she claims. The ouster of Hosni Mubarak and the political chaos that ensued sent Egypt\u2019s society into a tailspin, leaving voters yearning for a strongman who could assert control and bring back order.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Although Gelfand can occasionally come across as too much of a salesperson for her big idea, she\u2019s generally an engaging writer with real intellectual range. She sparkles most when diving into evolutionary anthropology to make sense of long-term patterns in cultural tightness and looseness. Humans have evolved to be strikingly sensitive to norms, which provide a major evolutionary advantage as a way of facilitating cooperation. \u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The problem is that \u2014 in spite of the context she provides for how norms developed in the first place \u2014 Gelfand routinely ignores materialist explanations for the various phenomena she considers. Sure, would-be strongmen can and do exploit voters\u2019 fears of instability and change. But another crucial element in explaining why Sisi, Egypt\u2019s former minister of defence, won 96 percent of the vote is that the military, determined to maintain its grip on the country and to keep billions of dollars in foreign aid flowing, banned the main opposition, the Muslim Brotherhood, after deposing Mohamed Morsi, the inept but democratically-elected Islamist president who followed Mubarak in office.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Other examples are even more glaring, as when Gelfand accounts for limited upward mobility in the United States by pointing to the ostensibly tight culture of the working class. She writes as though the hoarding of resources and opportunities by the wealthy was not a huge part of the story\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

And yet Jane Austen remains not only well-read but culturally present and alive to an extent that other classic novelists (excepting Dickens) do not. It is worth understanding why, not so much in order to appreciate Austen more deeply but in order to see what cultural life the novel may still have in it. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the Victorian era, the Tories (the term became a shorthand for members of the conservative party) felt queasy about the cultural effects of industrialization.

And yet Jane Austen remains not only well-read but culturally present and alive to an extent that other classic novelists (excepting Dickens) do not. It is worth understanding why, not so much in order to appreciate Austen more deeply but in order to see what cultural life the novel may still have in it. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the Victorian era, the Tories (the term became a shorthand for members of the conservative party) felt queasy about the cultural effects of industrialization. They praised Austen for documenting a time of quiet, domestic triumph, when England\u2019s best families \u201cvegetated quietly on a fixed income.\u201d In 1900, the Church of England tried to memorialize this domestic and pious version of Austen by installing a stained glass window honouring her in Winchester Cathedral, where she had been buried years before. After its unveiling, the Winchester Diocesan Chronicle announced that the \u201cobject of the figures and text was to illustrate the high moral and religious teaching\u201d of Austen\u2019s writing. The \u201cmoral\u201d part is plausible, but as for \u201creligious,\u201d apparently nobody told the editors of the <i>W</i><i>i</i><i>n</i><i>c</i><i>h</i><i>e</i><i>s</i><i>t</i><i>e</i><i>r</i><i> </i><i>D</i><i>i</i><i>o</i><i>c</i><i>e</i><i>s</i><i>a</i><i>n</i><i> </i><i>C</i><i>h</i><i>r</i><i>o</i><i>n</i><i>i</i><i>c</i><i>l</i><i>e</i> that Mr Collins, the stupidest person in <i>P</i><i>r</i><i>i</i><i>d</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>a</i><i>n</i><i>d</i><i> </i><i>P</i><i>r</i><i>e</i><i>j</i><i>u</i><i>d</i><i>i</i><i>c</i><i>e</i> and one of the great figures of ridicule in English fiction, is a clergyman. After 1914 the emphasis shifted. And suddenly it was Austen\u2019s detachment and glinting irony that people admired. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Running alongside this persistent interest in Austen as a model of English character has been an obsession with the habits, houses, opinions, clothes and mysteries of the author herself. In 1901, Constance Hill published <i>J</i><i>a</i><i>n</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>A</i><i>u</i><i>s</i><i>t</i><i>e</i><i>n</i><i>:</i><i> </i><i>H</i><i>e</i><i>r</i><i> </i><i>H</i><i>o</i><i>m</i><i>e</i><i>s</i><i> </i><i>a</i><i>n</i><i>d</i><i> </i><i>h</i><i>e</i><i>r</i><i> </i><i>F</i><i>r</i><i>i</i><i>e</i><i>n</i><i>d</i><i>s</i>, a kind of extended literary pilgrimage to the places where Austen lived and worked. It set off such a frenzy of Janeism that within a few years Henry James would be complaining about \u201cthe body of publishers, editors, [and] illustrators. \u2026 who have found their \u2018dear\u2019, our dear, everybody\u2019s dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The original, early-20<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup> century outburst of Janeism may well have faded into historical obscurity were it not for an English tutor named Robert William Chapman who, in 1923 published Jane Austen\u2019s novels in a scholarly edition. Chapman\u2019s five-volume set made Austen academically respectable. A novelist\u2019s public popularity may wax and wane, but universities can ensure that a writer\u2019s long-term reputation weathers periods of disregard. It is thanks to Chapman that we can consider Austen\u2019s works, as Henry James put it, \u201cshelved and safe for all time.\u201d\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>M</b><b>a</b><b>n</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>c</b><b>r</b><b>i</b><b>t</b><b>i</b><b>c</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>n</b><b>o</b><b>w</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b>s</b><b>c</b><b>r</b><b>i</b><b>b</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>A</b><b>u</b><b>s</b><b>t</b><b>e</b><b>n</b><b>\u2019</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>p</b><b>r</b><b>i</b><b>m</b><b>a</b><b>r</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>i</b><b>m</b><b>p</b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b>t</b><b>a</b><b>n</b><b>c</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>o</b><b> </b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b> </b><b>i</b><b>n</b><b>v</b><b>e</b><b>n</b><b>t</b><b>i</b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>f</b><b> </b><b>\u201c</b><b>f</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>i</b><b>n</b><b>d</b><b>i</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b>c</b><b>t</b><b> </b><b>d</b><b>i</b><b>s</b><b>c</b><b>o</b><b>u</b><b>r</b><b>s</b><b>e</b><b>,</b><b>\u201d</b><b> </b><b>w</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b>b</b><b>y</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>v</b><b>o</b><b>i</b><b>c</b><b>e</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>f</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b> </b><b>n</b><b>o</b><b>v</b><b>e</b><b>l</b><b>\u2019</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>c</b><b>h</b><b>a</b><b>r</b><b>a</b><b>c</b><b>t</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b>s</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b>r</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>a</b><b>l</b><b>l</b><b>o</b><b>w</b><b>e</b><b>d</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>o</b><b> </b><b>i</b><b>n</b><b>f</b><b>l</b><b>e</b><b>c</b><b>t</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>r</b><b> </b><b>e</b><b>v</b><b>e</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>a</b><b>k</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>o</b><b>v</b><b>e</b><b>r</b><b> </b><b>t</b><b>h</b><b>e</b><b> </b><b>n</b><b>a</b><b>r</b><b>r</b><b>a</b><b>t</b><b>i</b><b>o</b><b>n</b><b> </b><b>i</b><b>t</b><b>s</b><b>e</b><b>l</b><b>f</b><b>.</b> Take the section in Emma where we are told that Emma is considering how she can influence Harriet Smith: \u201cIt would be an interesting, and certainly very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers\u201d.

But over time, computer simulations suggest, this heat-driven magnetic field alone wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to power a strong magnetic field. Instead, the magnetic field began to shut down, signalled in the rock record by weakening intensities and rapid polarity reversals over millions of years. Then, at some point, Earth\u2019s inner core began to crystallize, jump-starting the geodynamo and generating a new, strong magnetic field.<b>\n</b></font><b>\n</b></font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Now scientists think they\u2019ve found evidence of when that magnetic field breakdown was happening. Geophysicist John Tarduno examined lava flows and magnetic inclusions (needle-like iron-rich grains that align themselves with the orientation of the magnetic field that existed when the lava hardened and rocks formed) in rocks in Quebec, dating to about 565 million years ago. He found that the planet\u2019s magnetic field was extremely weak at that time, with paleo-intensity values ten times less than current values. The magnetic field was also rapidly reversing polarity during that time period. The new result indicates that Earth\u2019s field may have been on the point of collapse about 565 million years ago. That suggests that the inner core hadn\u2019t yet solidified.

That means the scientists haven\u2019t just captured a snapshot in time of a fluctuating field, but have found a true, persistent signal. Computer simulations have suggested that the weak field phase may have lasted much longer, from about 900 million to 600 million years ago. More paleo-intensity data from within that time span, as well as from other locations, would help to confirm that the observed weak phase really signalled the final throes of that pre\u2013inner core field.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Peter Driscoll, a renowned geophysicist, was one theoretician who estimated how long the weak phase might have lasted.

It promises politicians the luxury of no longer having to worry about unemployment. And it would give companies an elegant way to justify job cuts [\u2026] as those affected would be financially secure and could look after their children at home or pursue hobbies.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Nevertheless, basic income is a dead end. The most common reason cited for this conclusion is financing: though its costs have not been quantified, it is certain that they would be high. Just how income and wealth should be taxed to pay for it remains an open question. Radically transforming the social system to create a basic income would be the greatest financial gamble in recent history.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the financial aspect is not even the most important argument against a basic income. Basic income is a seductive poison. It would benefit the margins of society at the expense of the middle class\u2026It most likely would not cost the rich any more than before and would help ease their conscience. Growing inequality would no longer be a social scandal, since everyone would have an income, albeit close to the poverty line. It is precisely for this reason that there are three main arguments against an unconditional basic income.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">First, basic income would further divide society and prevent social mobility. Those who, due to family background, have good prospects for interesting employment and high income would engage in school and study. However, life would become more difficult for young people from working-class and migrant families who are already at a disadvantage in terms of education. The sweet poison of basic income would accompany them at every step of their school life and vocational training. Any resolve to invest in themselves and to improve their lives through work would be put to the test every day, and at [a young] age. And society would be much less concerned about this dilemma than it is today, as everyone would be provided for.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Second, [\u2026] it is impossible to imagine a model that benefits all parts of society equally. Basic income would redistribute resources from those who are employed to those who are not. An unconditional basic income is, in principle, based on a citizen\u2019s right to income, but in reality, a basic income scheme is the opposite of social solidarity with the weaker members of society. The middle class, who would finance the basic income but who would not benefit from it materially, are unlikely to find social justice or solidarity in this \u201cunconditional\u201d redistribution. This is one reason why large redistribution programs are unpopular among voters, even among those who are likely to benefit from it.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Third, an unconditional basic income runs counter to the needs of a society with rapidly growing immigration. Migrant workers and other immigrants need more mechanisms to help with social integration, not fewer \u2026 It would be fatal to give people a reason to stop working, to stop improving their qualifications, and to simply stay at home\u2026 \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

For instance, if a woman has demonstrated certain skills in learning new things, she is favoured as a candidate for retailing phone service. Another factor is the location of her house; a central location in the village is preferred. Grameen Bank also ensures that at least one member of the family of a village phone operator knows English letters and numbers. There is also a great deal of social impact due to this new service. With some of the poorest women in the villages holding in their hand instruments of global communication, there are ripples in the highly stratified villages. Even a relatively rich person in the village is walking up to a poor woman's home for a service he needs. The phone service being retailed in these villages almost exclusively by women, a situation due to the fact that 94% of borrowers of the Grameen Bank are women, is turning out to be another good thing. Since it is the men who tend to go to the cities for work or trade or even to foreign countries as migrant workers, it is the women left behind in the villages who need to contact their men travelling or residing outside. The women naturally feel more comfortable going to other women to make phone calls.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

However, the same faculties are employed in both cases; and in both cases their mode of operation is fundamentally the same. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If we say that science is organised knowledge, we are met by the truth that all knowledge is organised \u2013 that the commonest actions of the household and the field presuppose facts colligated, inferences drawn, results expected; and that the general success of these actions proves the data by which they were guided to have been correctly put together. If we say that science is prevision \u2013 is a seeing beforehand \u2013 is a knowing in what times, places, combinations, specified phenomena will be found; we are obliged to confess that the definition includes much that is utterly foreign to science in its ordinary acceptation. For example, a child\u2019s knowledge of an apple. This, as far as it goes, consists in previsions. When a child sees a certain form and colours, it knows that if it puts out its hand it will have certain impressions of resistance, and roundness, and smoothness. And its general acquaintance with surrounding objects is of like nature \u2013 is made up of facts concerning them, so grouped as that any part of a group being perceived, the existence of the other facts included in it is foreseen. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If we say that science is exact prevision, we still fail to establish the supposed difference. Not only do we find that much of what we call science is not exact, and that some of it, as physiology, can never become exact; but we find further, that many of the previsions constituting the common stock alike of wise and ignorant, are exact. That an unsupported body will fall and many like predictions relating to the familiar properties of things have as high a degree of accuracy as predictions are capable of\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Seeing thus that the assumed distinction between scientific knowledge and common knowledge cannot be sustained; however impossible it may be to draw a line between them, the two are not practically identical; there arises the question \u2013 what is the relationship between them? A partial answer to this question may be drawn from the illustrations just given. It will be observed that those portions of ordinary knowledge identical in character with scientific knowledge, comprehend only such combinations of phenomena as are directly cognizable by the senses, and are of simple, invariable nature. They consist of previsions concerning phenomena in constant and direct relation \u2013 phenomena that follow visibly and immediately after their antecedents \u2013 phenomena which may be predicted by the simplest possible act of reasoning. If, now, we pass to the previsions constituting science \u2013 that an eclipse of the moon will happen at a specified time \u2013 we perceive that the relations involved are not of a kind habitually presented to our senses. They depend, some of them, on special combinations of causes; and often the connexion between antecedents and consequents is established only by an elaborate series of inferences. A broad distinction, therefore, between scientific knowledge and common knowledge is its remoteness from perception. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Such pacts used to be called free-trade agreements; in fact, they were managed trade agreements, tailored to corporate interests, largely in the US and the EU. Today, such deals are more often referred to as partnerships, as in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But they are not partnerships of equals: the US effectively dictates the terms.

Of course, investors have to be protected against rogue governments seizing their property. But that is not what these provisions are about. There have been very few expropriations in recent decades, and investors who want to protect themselves can buy insurance from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, a World Bank affiliate, and the US and other governments provide similar insurance. Nonetheless, the US is demanding such provisions in the TPP, even though many of its partners have property protections and judicial systems that are as good as its own. The real intent of these provisions is to impede health, environmental, safety, and, yes, even financial regulations meant to protect America\u2019s own economy and citizens. Companies can sue governments for full compensation for any reduction in their future-expected profits resulting from regulatory changes.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is not just a theoretical possibility.

Corporations, however, are just learning how to use these agreements to their advantage. And high-priced corporate lawyers in the US, Europe and Japan will likely outmatch the underpaid government lawyers attempting to defend the public interest.

Their research showed that a single family tree stretches its branches unbroken across most of Eurasia: from Iceland to Bangladesh, most people speak \u201cdaughter languages\u201d [that have many similarities] descended from [a common or \u201cmother\u201d tongue] \u201cProto-Indo-European\u201d. Parallels in vocabulary and grammar quickly emerged among foreign languages, particularly in what were then the oldest preserved tongues: Latin, Greek and Sanskrit. The philologists had a theory to explain why Sanskrit, the ancient forebear of Hindi, has closer cousins in Europe than in south India: the Sanskrit word for \u201cthree\u201d <i>t</i><i>r</i><i>a</i><i>y</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i> </i>is cognate (i.e. having the same etymological origin) with Latin <i>t</i><i>r</i><i>e</i><i>s</i> and Greek <i>t</i><i>r</i><i>e</i><i>i</i><i>s</i>, also words for \u201cthree\u201d. They speculated that at some point before the composition of the Vedas, an Aryan (Indo-European) people had migrated into India from the north-west, while their kin pushed westward into Europe.... \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The presence of a long-lost common language presupposes the historical existence of a common culture which spread as the Indo-Europeans settled in different areas of the world. Jacob Grimm (a Linguistics scholar) noticed a pattern in the evolution of a linguistic variant, Common Germanic as it developed out of Proto-Indo-European. The change [called the Great Consonant Shift] in Germanic languages began when a certain type of consonant called unvoiced (<i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>) transformed into its aspirate<b> </b>equivalents (<i>p</i><i>h</i>, <i>t</i><i>h</i>, <i>k</i><i>h</i>). Consequently, what had originally been aspirates in Common Germanic (<i>p</i><i>h</i>, <i>t</i><i>h</i>, <i>k</i><i>h</i>) moved to their voiced equivalents (<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>). Thereafter, the original voiced consonants (<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>) did likewise and changed into their unvoiced counterparts (<i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>), thus taking Common Germanic consonants in a full circle: from unvoiced to aspirate to voiced\u2026 \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The Indo-Europeans are at present, in strictest terms, a linguistic phenomenon, as much about their history remains uncertain... Based on calculations of the general rate at which languages change, attempts have been made to reason out how long ago Proto-Indo-European began to break apart.

You\u2019re probably picturing them wrong. It\u2019s okay, you wouldn\u2019t be alone\u2026 From Greek vases to drawing handbooks to modern sculptures, even our very best artists can\u2019t seem to get the pose right.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">To successfully run, a person swings opposite arms and legs. As the right leg goes forward, the right arm goes back, and vice versa.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But if you were asked to draw a person running, many of you would have the resulting figure moving their right arm and right leg forward at the same time. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">When it comes to art, it\u2019s possible that rather than being an error, the one-sided lurch forward is an artistic choice. In Egyptian art, for example, artists followed strict rules about the position of the head and body. But as art evolved, and as accuracy of form became more and more important, it\u2019s hard to imagine why someone like Da Vinci or Donatello would intentionally draw a person running in such an inaccurate pose\u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Proprioception happens on multiple levels. There is information that the brain has built in about where arms and legs are (that information is why some people experience phantom limb pain after an amputation; their brains still thinks the limb is there). And there is also information coming in from the extremities. As you wiggle your fingers, your brain gets information coming in about what that feels like. How much of each of those two things \u2013 our internal map and our sensory input \u2013 make up proprioception is still a bit of a mystery, says Jens Foell, a researcher. But they\u2019re both involved, and they both happen in the background of your perception when you\u2019re asked to think about running position. \u201cIf you stretch out your hand to grab a pen, you\u2019re not thinking in terms of muscle tension, coordination of bones,  and so on,\u201d he says. The same goes for thinking about running. This is a common mistake when it comes to thinking about how we think about movement, says Andrew Wilson, a psychology researcher.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The standard story about learning goes something like this: You assemble a collection of pieces of information about a thing that builds to an internal representation of that thing. So as you learn to run, you\u2019re building a mental model of what running involves in your head \u2013 right arm goes forward, right leg goes back. Once you can accurately imagine the movement, you can tell your arms and legs to do it.

Even comedy, to be effective, dwells upon difficulty and confusion \u2014 until the happy ending hustles the lucky characters offstage before their blessings have a chance to cloy. As agents, we may aim at happiness, and utopia charms as an idea, but as spectators we prefer struggle and pain.

So can the complete collapse of whole states and economic systems, as at the end of the Tang dynasty in China and the disintegration of the western Roman Empire.

Financial crises increase inequality as often as they decrease it. Political reforms are mostly ineffectual, in part because they are often aimed at the balance of power between the straightforwardly wealthy and the politically powerful, rather than the lot of the have-nots. Land reform, debt relief and the emancipation of slaves will not necessarily buck the trend much, though their chances of doing so increase a bit if they are violent. But violence does not in itself lead to greater equality, except on a massive scale. \n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Perhaps the most fascinating part of this book is the careful accumulation of evidence showing that mass-mobilisation warfare was the defining underlying cause of the unprecedented decrease in inequality seen across much of the Western world between 1910 and 1970 (though the merry old Great Depression lent an unusual helping hand). By demanding sacrifice from all, the deployment of national resources on such a scale under such circumstances provides an unusually strong case for soaking the rich.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Income taxes and property taxes rose spectacularly during both world wars (the top income-tax rate reached 94% in America in 1944, with property taxes peaking at 77% in 1941). Physical damage to capital goods slashed the assets of the wealthy, too, as did post-war inflations. The wars also drove up membership in trade unions \u2013 one of the war-related factors that played a part in keeping inequality low for a generation after 1945 before it started to climb back up in the 1980s.\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Catastrophic levelling will be less likely in future. Pandemics are a real risk, but plagues similar in impact to the Black Death are not. Nor are total revolutions and wars fought over years by armies of millions. On top of that, since the Industrial Revolution, general prosperity, regardless of inequality, has risen. And in past decades, global inequality has fallen. \u2026\n</font>\n</font></p></span>\n",

Last week the government released a report on the likely temperature changes in the UK. It shows that life at the end of this century will bear no relationship to life at the beginning. It should have dominated the news for days. But it was too far away, too remote from current problems, too big to see. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Lord Giddens has been touting the hypothesis that people are reluctant to act on climate change until it becomes visible to them, by which time it will be too late. This thought, which has been common currency within the environment movement for at least 20 years, has been christened by this shrinking violet the &quot;Giddens&rsquo; Paradox&quot;. It ranks among his other major discoveries, like the Giddens&rsquo; Postulate (people wear fewer clothes when temperatures rise) and the Giddens&rsquo; Effect (the Earth goes round the Sun). But despite his outrageous expropriation, the point is valid: we resist taking radical action until we have no choice, whereupon it will have no effect. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Our resistance to change is not peculiar to environmental issues. When confronted by crisis, we try to stick to the script. [C]onfronting change means making use of parts of the brain which require more energy to engage. We perceive high levels of energy use much as we perceive pain. For good biological reasons we seek to avoid them. We engage with change only when we have to. &hellip;That&#39;s a horribly simplified account of some very complex processes, but you get the general idea. Change is pain, a change for the worse is double pain. We pretend it&rsquo;s not there, up to the point at which it starts hammering on the door. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So environmentalists seek to persuade us that we&rsquo;ll love the green transition. This &lsquo;downshifting&rsquo;, &lsquo;voluntary simplicity&rsquo; or &lsquo;alternative hedonism&rsquo; is presented as a change for the better. A new green deal will save the planet, the workforce and the economy. Energy efficiency will protect the bottom line and the biosphere. A less frantic life will allow us to enjoy the small wonders that surround us. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There is both exaggeration and truth in all this, but effective action also involves a change for the worse: regulation, rationing, austerity, state spending. &hellip; </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Everything we need to do has been made harder by debt. Net state debt now exceeds &pound;700bn. This introduces two environmental problems. The first is that there is no money left with which to fund a new green deal. The second is that we&rsquo;ll be able to pay off these debts only by resuming economic growth. Greenhouse gases grow because the economy grows. The UK&rsquo;s liabilities make the transition to a steady state economy, let alone a managed contraction, much harder to achieve. The debt crisis is an environmental disaster. </font> </font></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We could cut defence spending by 90% and suffer no loss to our national security. Instead, the MoD has just dropped its spending on climate change research. &hellip; The last time we faced a crisis on the scale of the global climate crash, we thought of building tanks as the rational solution. Now the rational solution is to stop building tanks, and use the money to address a real threat. </font> </font></span></p>",

Choose the best answer to each question. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'><b>T</b>he hard problem of consciousness [termed by David Chalmers] is the problem of explaining why any physical state is conscious rather than nonconscious, why there is \u00e2\u0080\u009csomething it is like\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a subject in conscious experience. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Even after one has explained the functional, dynamical, and structural properties of the conscious mind, one can still meaningfully ask a further question, <i>Why</i><i> is it conscious?</i> Consciousness presents a hard problem for science.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Explaining why consciousness occurs can be contrasted with so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009ceasy problems\u00e2\u0080\u009d of consciousness that are susceptible to standard methods of cognitive science, where phenomena are explained through computational and neural mechanisms. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 A system is said to be conscious of some information when it attends to that information and reacts to it, or when it can integrate that information and exploit it in the sophisticated control of behaviour. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The easy problems can be explained scientifically. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think, there is information-processing and a subjective aspect called experience. But the question of how organisms are subjects of experience is perplexing. When our cognitive systems engage in visual and auditory information-processing, why do we have visual or auditory experience: the quality of deep blue, the sensation of a musical note? How can we explain why there is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an emotion?...</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>What makes the hard problem unique is that it goes beyond problems [and is] about the performance of functions. Even when one has explained the performance of all the cognitive and behavioural functions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 perceptual discrimination, categorization, internal access, verbal report \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the vicinity of experience, there remains a further question: <i>Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience?</i></p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Chalmers explains the persistence of this question by arguing against the possibility of a \u00e2\u0080\u009creductive explanation\u00e2\u0080\u009d for consciousness which cannot be functionally analysed... [A reductive explanation in Chalmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense provides a form of deductive argument concluding with an identity statement between the target explanandum (the thing we are trying to explain) and a lower-level phenomenon that is physical in nature or more obviously reducible to the physical] \u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Joseph Levine argues that a good scientific explanation should <i>deductively entail</i>\u00c2\u00a0what it explains, allowing one to infer the presence of the target phenomenon from a statement of laws, mechanisms and initial conditions. Deductive entailment is a logical relation where if the premises of an argument are true, the conclusion <i>must </i>be true. If such a deduction is impossible, then one has either a) not fully specified the laws/ mechanisms, or b) the target phenomenon is stochastic in nature, that is one can only infer the <i>probability</i> of the occurrence of the explanatory target or c) there are unknown factors involved in determining the phenomenon. If one has adequately specified the laws / mechanisms, and adjusted for stochastic phenomena, then one should possess a deductive conclusion about one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explanatory target, or the third possibility is in effect. But the third possibility is \u00e2\u0080\u009cprecisely an admission that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an adequate explanation\u00e2\u0080\u009d. And this is the case with consciousness, says Levine. One is left with the explanatory gap between the physical and consciousness, the hard problem.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

Choose the best answer to each question.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'><b>D</b>oes death really mean the end of our existence? Great thinkers from Plato to Blue \u00c3\u0096yster Cult have weighed in on the question. Now, a study by microbiologist Peter Noble of the University of Washington, Seattle, and colleagues shows that at least one aspect of life continues: Genes remain turned on days after animals die. Researchers may be able to parlay this postmortem activity into better ways of preserving donated organs for transplantation and more accurate methods of determining when murder victims were killed. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Although scientists analyzing blood and liver tissue from human cadavers had previously noted the postmortem activity of a few genes, Noble and colleagues systematically evaluated more than 1000. The team measured which of these genes were functioning in tissues from recently deceased mice and zebrafish, tracking changes for 4 days in the fish and 2 days in the rodents.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>At first, the researchers assumed that genes would shut down shortly after death, like the parts of a car that has run out of gas. What they found instead was that hundreds of genes ramped up. Although most of these genes upped their activity in the first 24 hours after the animals expired and then tapered off, in the fish some genes remained active 4 days after death.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Many of these postmortem genes are beneficial in emergencies; they perform tasks such as spurring inflammation, firing up the immune system, and counteracting stress. Other genes were more surprising. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw-dropping is that developmental genes are turned on after death,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Noble says. These genes normally help sculpt the embryo, but they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t needed after birth. One possible explanation for their postmortem reawakening, the researchers say, is that cellular conditions in newly dead corpses resemble those in embryos. The team also found that several genes that promote cancer became more active. That result could explain why people who receive transplants from the recently deceased have a higher risk of cancer, Noble says. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>In an accompanying paper, Noble and two colleagues demonstrated another possible use for gene activity measurements, showing that they can provide better estimates of the time of death. Those results impress forensic scientist David Carter of Chaminade University of Honolulu. Although making a time of death estimate is crucial for many criminal investigations, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are not very good at it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. Such estimates often rely on evidence that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t directly connected to the body, such as the last calls or texts on the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cellphone. Noble and his colleagues, Carter says, have \u00e2\u0080\u009cestablished a technique that has a great deal of potential to help death investigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>A mouse or zebrafish doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t benefit, no matter which genes turn on after its death. The patterns of gene activity that the researchers observed may represent what happens when the complex network of interacting genes that normally keeps an organism functioning unwinds. Some genes may turn on, for example, because other genes that normally help kept them silent have shut off. By following these changes, researchers might be able to learn more about how these networks evolved, Noble says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe headline of this study is that we can probably get a lot of information about life by studying death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

Choose the best answer to each question.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'><b>H</b>ow may one characterise the relation between the disciplines of psychoanalysis and law? It will not do to say simply that it is a relation of friendly cooperation or one of hostile suspicion. The psychoanalyst, on one hand, regards the maintenance of a system of law and justice as a necessary condition for personal equilibrium. On the other hand, he regards much of the law as antiquated/outworn and often criticises it as based on theoretical/ moral ideas which have survived their usefulness. The men of law sometimes welcome the insights into human motivation which psychoanalysis has contributed. At other times, lawyers show hostile defensiveness in the face of the analysts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sweeping criticisms of the law. The principal focus of tension between psychoanalysis and law is the general concept of responsibility. Legal tradition asserts that men exercise free choice. However, Franz Alexander says that psychoanalysis<i> </i>considers the human psychic apparatus as a system determined by psychological/biological causative factors, where free will is an illusion and where the Super-Ego rules. ...</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Alexander identifies four categories of criminals. In psychotics and defectives, criminal acts are traceable to organic degeneration and ego participation is entirely absent. Among neurotic criminals, there is a variety in the degree of ego participation. In persons with specific neurotic symptoms,  ego participation is almost zero. In general neurotic characters, the ego, which plays a larger role, assents to the overt conduct but there is no awareness of the subjective meaning of the conduct, and rationalisation and projection are typically involved. In normal (professional) criminals, the criminal is without unconscious conflict, In his conduct, there is a nearly full ego participation. These three categories include \u00e2\u0080\u009cchronic\u00e2\u0080\u009d criminals. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009csituational\u00e2\u0080\u009d (acute) criminal, there is complete ego participation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 here the circumstances are so painful that the individual feels released from the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbargain\u00e2\u0080\u009d which normally keeps his behaviour within the law.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>This summary of the psychoanalytic view of the criminal law function suggests that a working agreement is possible between \u00e2\u0080\u0098lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098analyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099. They should be able to agree that individuals who are deterred by threat of punishment, those in whose conduct a high degree of ego participation is manifested, are to be held responsible as if their acts sprang from free choice. As to the mentally ill where criminal conduct isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deterred by punishment, it is inappropriate to treat them in the same fashion. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>However, lawyers have balked at any such working agreement with psychiatrists. The typical lawyer, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 assumes that legal responsibility is related to moral responsibility\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [which] presupposes freedom of choice. Judges and legislators have hesitated to follow the lead of psychiatrists in defining the class of the irresponsible. They insist on the traditional \u00e2\u0080\u009cright and wrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d test, under which evidence of mental illness may be considered only if it establishes that the accused was unable to understand the moral nature of his act.

Choose the best answer to each question. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'><b>I</b>t is a platitude that cultures change over time. Researchers study the nature of these changes. Modern cultural evolutionary theory portrays the human capacity for cultural change as both a product of genetic evolution and an evolutionary process. The parameters of the cultural evolutionary process are tuned by genetic evolution to lead to outcomes enhancing genetic fitness. The evolutionary-biologist Edward Wilson claimed that human culture is held on a genetic leash: imagine a dog-walker (gene) struggling to retain control of a mastiff (culture)!</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>The term \u00e2\u0080\u009cdual inheritance theory\u00e2\u0080\u009d signifies a more symmetrical relationship between genetic and cultural evolution as two streams of information that replicate across generations and mutually influence each other. That the cultural stream evolved by genetic evolution says little about their current relationship. The genetic stream of inheritance can someday be controlled by the cultural stream.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Where have cultural anthropologists been during the development of dual inheritance theory? For the most part, absent! This theory is like a party thrown by evolutionary theorists where cultural anthropologists weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invited/ didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to come. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Robert Paul is the first cultural anthropologist brave enough to apply [the principles of his field] to dual inheritance theory without apology. He wants to make the cultural stream of inheritance come to life with ethnographic examples chosen from different cultures. If we invert Wilson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leash metaphor by associating genetic evolution with \u00e2\u0080\u009cdog\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cultural evolution with \u00e2\u0080\u009cman\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then Paul provides many examples of \u00e2\u0080\u009cman bites dog\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or cultural evolution circumscribing genetic evolution.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>For example, a surprising number of cultures in the past have perpetuated themselves by importing children (i.e., through immigration) rather than through biological reproduction. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The incoming children must adopt the culture\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customs\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Paul rightly understands that the great challenge (and genetic payoff) of the cultural stream of inheritance is to suppress disruptive forms of competition within groups so that the group can function as a cooperative unit. .... The implication for anthropology, Paul says, is that evolutionary theorists should consider the critical work the cultural system does in human social life, while cultural anthropologists should consider the need facing any human socio-cultural system to sustain biological reproduction, and forge an effective compromise. The prospects of this happening are rather dim; but only because the dynamics Wilson has identified are also operative in the society of anthropologists: for isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it the genetic program and the cultural program duking it out once again and preventing us from seeing that a complete account of human social life cannot be \u00e2\u0080\u009ceither/or,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but must be \u00e2\u0080\u009cboth/and\u00e2\u0080\u009d?</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

Choose the best answer to each question.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'><b>P</b>olitical scientists, like other social and natural scientists, gather data and formulate theories. The two tasks are often out of balance, leading either to the collection of irrelevant facts or to the construction of misleading theories. Throughout the post-World War II era, political scientists developed and discarded numerous theories, and there was considerable debate as to whether it is more important to develop theories and then collect data to [validate] them or to collect and analyze data from which theories would flow. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Prior to the development of reliable survey research, most political analyses focused on elites. Once a sizable amount of research had become available, there was a considerable debate about whether rulers are guided by citizen preferences, expressed through interest groups and elections, or whether elites pursue their own goals and manipulate public opinion to achieve their ends. Despite numerous studies of public opinion, voting behaviour, and interest groups, the issue [remains] unresolvable. Analyses can establish statistical relationships, but it has been difficult to demonstrate causality with any certainty. This debate is complicated by two factors. First, although there is a considerable body of survey and electoral data, most people ignore politics most of the time, a factor that must be considered in attempting to understand which part of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic\u00e2\u0080\u009d policymakers listen to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all citizens, all voters, or only those expressing an intense view on a particular matter. Political analyses based on elites are hindered by a dearth of reliable elite-level data, as researchers are rarely invited into the deliberations of rulers. Accordingly, much is known about the social bases of politics but little of how and why decisions are made. Even when decision-makers grant interviews or write their memoirs, firm conclusions remain elusive, because officials often provide accounts that are self-serving or misleading.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Political science has had difficulty handling rapid change; it prefers the static (stable political systems) to the dynamic. If historians are stuck in the past, political scientists are often captives of the present. For some, the collapse of the Soviet Union showed that the theories and methods of political science are of only limited utility. Despite decades of gathering data and theorizing, political science was unable to anticipate the defining event of the post-World War II era. Critics charged that political science could describe what is but could never discern what was likely to be. Others, however, maintained that this criticism was unfair, arguing that such upheavals can be predicted, given sufficient data...</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>At the beginning of the 21st century, political science was faced with a stark dilemma: the more scientific it tried to be, the more removed it found itself from the burning issues of the day. Although some research in political science would continue to be arcane and unintelligible to the layperson and even to other scholars, many political scientists attempted to steer a middle course, one that maintained a rigorous scientific approach but also addressed questions that are important to academics, citizens, and decision makers alike. Indeed, some political scientists, recognizing that many \u00e2\u0080\u009cscientific\u00e2\u0080\u009d approaches had lost their utility after a decade or two, suggested that the discipline should cease its attempts to imitate the natural sciences and return to the classic concerns of analysing and promoting the political good.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

The metaethics or normative ethics are cognitivist, laying down various necessary conditions for ethically correct action.

To imagine the enormity of the consequences of sin, yet to relish the possibilities of freedom, engenders anxiety. We need to learn to navigate the treacherous maelstroms of despair (to let one's life depend on conditions outside one's control), to recognize the self-absorption of demonic states, to veer away from prudence and vanity, and to avoid mere conformity to social mores.

Choose the best answer to each question.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'><b>T</b>he ethical position advocated by Kierkegaard in \u00e2\u0080\u009cEquilibrium Between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Composition of Personality\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a peculiar mix of cognitivism and noncognitivism. The metaethics or normative ethics are cognitivist, laying down various necessary conditions for ethically correct action. These conditions include: the necessity of choosing seriously and inwardly commitment to the belief that predications of good and evil of our actions have a truth-value; the necessity of choosing what one is actually doing, rather than just responding to a situation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>The choice of metaethics, however, is noncognitive. There is no adequate proof of the truth of metaethics. The choice of normative ethics is motivated, but in a noncognitive way... For Kierkegaard, the choice of normative ethics is a noncognitive choice of cognitivism, and thereby an acceptance of the applicability of the conceptual distinction between good and evil. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>From Kierkegaard's religious perspective, however, the conceptual distinction between good and evil is ultimately dependent not on social norms but on God. Therefore, it is possible, as Johannes de Silentio argues was the case for Abraham (the father of faith who was asked by God to offer his son Isaac as a burnt offering), that God demand a suspension of the ethical. This is still ethical in the second sense, since ultimately God's definition of the distinction between good and evil outranks any human society's definition\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 This renders cases such as Abraham's extremely problematic, since we have no recourse to public reason to decide whether he is legitimately obeying God's command or whether he is a deluded would-be murderer. Since public reason cannot decide the issue for us, we must decide for ourselves as a matter of religious faith.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Kierkegaard's ultimate advocacy of divine command metaethics is tempered somewhat by his detailed analyses of the nuanced ways individuals need to relate to God's commands. These analyses amount to a subtle moral psychology, which borders on virtue ethics. It is not enough simply for God to issue a command; we need to hear and obey. But obedience is not straightforward\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 In order to obey we first need to cultivate faith, since obedience to a divine command is nonsense unless we at least believe the command has come from God. To cultivate faith in a transcendent, eternal, omnipresent God, who allegedly became incarnate in the form of a particular human being who was put to death, requires one to overcome the offense to one's reason and to adopt a tolerance for paradox. To imagine the enormity of the consequences of sin, yet to relish the possibilities of freedom, engenders anxiety. We need to learn to navigate the treacherous maelstroms of despair (to let one's life depend on conditions outside one's control), to recognize the self-absorption of demonic states, to veer away from prudence and vanity, and to avoid mere conformity to social mores. We also need to cultivate hope, patience, devotion, and above all love. We also need to be vigilant about our capacity for self-deception and be prepared to suffer for love and for our ultimate spiritual identity.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

It is about the formation of public will and public purpose, the determination of the public interest, what should be conserved and what reformed, what should be public and what private, and the rules by which societies should be governed.

On the one hand, the author becomes supremely individualistic, someone who creates out of a spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling rather than by correctly and cleverly applying the approved thematic, poetical and rhetorical conventions; whose person is that of Byron rather than Dr Johnson. On the other hand, there is a de-individualisation of the author; he is merely an Aeolian harp, responding to the vibrancies and inspirations that waft through him, who becomes de-individualised as he loses himself in an inspiration that is collective or spiritual rather than personal, in this sense, the poet can become the voice of his nation, and his role is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cforge the uncreated conscience of his race in the smithy of his soul\u00e2\u0080\u009d.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>The belief that the \u00e2\u0080\u0098nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is the collective author and articulator of a collective consciousness: that notion is what I wish to trace here, and the Romantic period, which celebrates the poet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Self at the same time that it glorifies the collective folk effusions of popular balladry and fairy-tale, is a crucial period to scrutinise in this respect. The origin of this idea can be found in Giambattista Vico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <i>Scienza Nuova </i>of 1725, which posited the view that each nation enters the stage of world history in a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Big Bang\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of collective self-articulation involving, in one originary foundational moment, the crystallization of its mythology, epic poetry, language, and law.

Choose the best answer to each question. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'><b>I</b>t has been known since long that some genes move from one species to other widely different species given the chance, in a process called horizontal gene transfer [e.g., genes for antibiotic resistance swap freely between bacterial species].</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Alastair and Boschetti [of Cambridge University] report in <i>Genome Biology </i>that humans have at least 145 genes picked up from other species by their forebears. Though this is less than 1% of the 20,000 genes that humans have altogether, humans are (to a small degree) part bacterium, part fungus and part alga.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>The researchers concluded this by looking at public databases of genetic information now available. They studied humans and nine other primates, twelve types of fruit fly and four nematode worms. The results from all three groups suggest natural transgenics is ubiquitous.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>To avoid getting bogged down in the billions of base pairs of an animal genome, the researchers looked at the transcriptome [the set of messenger molecules, made of a DNA-like chemical called RNA, that pick up instructions on how to make proteins from genes in the nucleus and deliver them to the subcellular factories which turn those proteins out]. Each type of messenger RNA corresponds to a single gene. By looking at the messengers, the researchers could ascertain they were recording active genes and not stretches of nuclear DNA that had once been genes but now no longer work.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>For every transcribed messenger, they searched the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s databases, looking for matches. They excluded the immediate relatives of each of the three groups of animals (i.e., no arthropods were compared with flies, no vertebrates with primates and no other nematodes with worms). They asked whether similar-looking genes to those in a transcriptome were found more often in other animals, or in non-animals. If the latter, then, a horizontal gene transfer from species to species seemed probable. On average, worms had 173 horizontally transferred genes, flies had 40 and primates had 109. Humans thus had more than the primate mean.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Many matches are to genes of unknown purpose [even 15 years after the human genome project, the functions of many genes remain obscure]. But some human transgenes appear familiar. The ABO antigen system, which defines basic blood groups for transfusion purposes, looks bacterial. The fat-mass and obesity-associated gene comes from marine algae. Genes involved in the synthesis of hyaluronic acid originate from fungi. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>The researchers found two imported genes for amino-acid metabolism, thirteen for fat metabolism, fifteen for post-manufacture modification of large molecules .... and seven immune-system genes.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Quite a catalogue! If anything similar were inserted by genetic engineers into corn or cattle, there would be an outcry (opponents of genetically modified crops complain that moving genes between species is unnatural). In humans, however, they are doing a good job. Many of them have been cohabiting with the line that led to humanity for millions of years, and both sides have had ample time to adjust. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

Soon after ratification of the Constitution the characteristically American pattern of two parties locked in ambivalent hostility crystallized briefly in the rivalry of Federalists and Republicans. Federalism, increasingly pro-British and regional to New England, disintegrated after the War of 1812, as some of its partisans receded into political impotence while others, especially outside New England, came to terms with the ascendant opposition. By contrast, the Republicans swept on to a decade of unchallenged dominance. Often misleadingly referred to as the Era of Good Feeling, this interval of one-party government actually nourished a ferocious intraparty factionalism that erupted into rebellion against the last Republican administration, that of John Quincy Adams. Andrew Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential victory over Adams in 1828 led to a renewal of overt party competition known to historians as the Second American Party System.

The aim, then, is to prevent or at least reduce the undesirable consequences of such a development. In this guise, then, macroprudential policy is concerned with financial stability. It works, by, for example, raising equity requirements of lenders or borrowers in a boom.

Without a social contract, humanity is limited to a zero-sum struggle for finite resources, what Hobbes describes as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098war of everyone against everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099. We choose the \u00e2\u0080\u0098covenant\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the state to ensure our \u00e2\u0080\u0098preservation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and a \u00e2\u0080\u0098contented life\u00e2\u0080\u0099. And, while all forms of government involve the loss of individual liberty, only monarchy secures the greatest stability and peace because it is least subject to alteration.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Like Hobbes, Locke bases much of his political reasoning on an extended analogy between states and bodies. Yet while Hobbes defended absolute monarchy, Locke wrote his Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 to justify the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which strengthened Parliament and resulted in the abdication of James II. For Locke, a body politic forms when every individual consents to be bound by the same impartial laws. The king cannot, by analogising himself to the brain, claim exemption from the laws that govern any other \u00e2\u0080\u0098part\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the body. Though Locke is still writing within the body politic metaphor, he is pushing at its limits: the hierarchy implied by the biological structure of the body is dissolving into a more horizontal model defined by consent of the governed, and the universal application of law. Hobbes argued that a strong monarch provides salvation from a state of nature; for Locke, however, rule by a monarch is worse than a state of nature.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Hobbes and Locke discern different dangers, but both share a largely defensive concept of government. Locke grants political bodies only a limited goal: \u00e2\u0080\u0098The great and chief end, therefore, of men uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Absent from this vision is Aristotle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea that the basic purpose of political life is human flourishing, not merely the provision of security and the protection of private property. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as if Hobbes and Locke were content to define the health of the body politic only by the absence of disease.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Yet seeing others and ourselves as parts of a larger metaphorical body reminds us of the crucial fact of our interdependence, helping to rescue us from what Hannah Arendt described as \u00e2\u0080\u0098the weightless irrelevance\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of our individual affairs. Meditation on the meaning of the body politic reminds us that the individual is fundamentally a component of a collective political organism. To avoid becoming an agglomeration of fractured and easily manipulated individuals\u00e2\u0080\u00a6we must return to the difficult task of negotiating a public defence of the body politic. If we fail to voice a collective vision of the body politic today, we are destined to pay an extreme price for our individualism: the loss of a world in which it is worth being free.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

Kuznets argued that inequality is low at low levels of development, rises during industrialisation and falls as countries reach economic maturity. Piketty offered an alternative explanation: that high levels of inequality are the natural state of modern economies. Unusual events such as world wars and the Great Depression disrupt that normal equilibrium by destroying capital and bringing higher taxes in the US and Europe.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Milanovic suggests that both are mistaken: across history, inequality has tended to flow in cycles (Kuznets waves). In the pre-industrial period, these waves were governed by Malthusian dynamics: inequality would rise as countries enjoyed a spell of high incomes, then fall as war or famine dragged average income back to subsistence level. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>With industrialisation, the forces creating Kuznets waves changed. In the 19th century, technological advance, globalization and policy shifts worked together in mutually reinforcing ways to produce economic change. Workers were reallocated from farms to factories, average incomes and inequality soared and the world became interconnected. Malign forces such as war and political upheaval, and benign forces such as increased education squeezed inequality to the lows of the 1970s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Since then, the rich world has been riding a new Kuznets wave, propelled by another era of economic change. Technological progress and trade work together to squeeze workers: cheap technology made in foreign economies undermines the bargaining power of rich-world workers directly, and makes it easier for firms to replace people with machines. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>This diagnosis carries with it a predictive element. Milanovic expects rich-world inequality to keep rising before eventually declining. Importantly, he argues that the downswing in inequality that occurs on the backside of a Kuznets wave is an inevitable result of the preceding rise. Where Piketty sees the inequality-compressing historical events of the early 20th century as an accident, Milanovic believes them to be the direct result of soaring inequality. The search for foreign investment opportunities engendered imperialism and set the stage for war. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>The conclusion of Milanovic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book is unsatisfying. A theory in which rising inequality triggers countervailing social dislocations feels intuitively right, but it leaves important questions unanswered. .... Milanovic's contributions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which broadly connate with those of Piketty \u00e2\u0080\u0093 offer a clearer picture of great economic puzzles and his bold theorising chips away at tired economic orthodoxies. But the grand theory does as much to reveal the scale of contemporary ignorance as to illuminate the mechanics of the global economy.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

It's not just that it's a stretch to imagine how our sleep connects us to other times and places; it's that we're not even there when it happens. Dreaming is a possible exception, since it's sometimes recoverable by our waking selves, which is part of why dreaming has a much longer historiography than the other 85% of the sleep cycle. But the other aspects of the sleeping self, characterized by non-productivity, maddening lumpishness, and obliviousness, are about as unavailable to us as is being born or dying. __________________________________</p>",

I can choose what to eat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and whom to vote for, but these choices are determined in part by my genes, my gender, my family background, etc \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t choose which genes or family to have.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>But now the belief in \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree will\u00e2\u0080\u009d suddenly becomes dangerous.

But when they heard the prophecy that Thetis would bear a son more powerful than his father, both withdrew in alarm. Since gods plan on sticking around forever, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a more powerful offspring to compete with them. So, Thetis married a mortal, King Peleus, and gave birth to Achilles. Mortals do like their children to outshine them. This myth might teach us something important. Autocrats who plan to rule in perpetuity don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to encourage the birth of ideas that might displace them. But liberal democracies inspire the creation of new visions, even at the price of questioning their own foundations.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

Choose the best answer to each question. </p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>...<b>F</b>inancial systems generate credit booms and busts: this is the chief reason for the instability of market economies. Hyman Minsky described the broad features of such booms and busts in his Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH). Minsky started with an explanation of investment. It is, in essence, an exchange of money today for money tomorrow. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [M]oney today can come from one of two sources: a firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own cash or that of others (for example, if the firm borrows from a bank). The balance between the two is the key question for the financial system.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Minsky distinguished between three kinds of financing. The first, which he called \u00e2\u0080\u009chedge financing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is the safest: firms rely on their future cash flow to repay all their borrowings. For this to work, they need to have very limited borrowings and healthy profits. The second, speculative financing, is a bit riskier: firms rely on their cash flow to repay the interest on their borrowings but must roll over their debt, wherein the borrower pays the lender an additional fee in order to extend the loan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s due date, to repay the principal. This should be manageable as long as the economy functions smoothly, but a downturn could cause distress. The third, Ponzi financing, is the most dangerous. Cashflow covers neither principal nor interest; firms are betting only that the underlying asset will appreciate by enough to cover their liabilities. If that fails to happen, they will be left exposed.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>...Minsky identified five stages in a bubble: \u00e2\u0080\u0098displacement\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - a trigger event, such as falling interest rates; \u00e2\u0080\u0098boom\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - when asset prices start rising; \u00e2\u0080\u0098euphoria\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - when investors throw caution to the wind; \u00e2\u0080\u0098profit-taking\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - when intelligent investors start taking profits; and \u00e2\u0080\u0098panic\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - a period of collapsing asset prices and mass bankruptcy. Displacement is an event that raises optimism, such as an innovation, access to new economic resources, or maybe a decline in the cost of funds. As the cycle unfolds, credit expands relative to the economy. This allows more people to borrow, normally against collateral and often against property collateral. The borrowing is used to buy assets and spend on investment and consumption. The former raises asset prices. The latter stimulates the economy. Both effects encourage people to borrow and spend even more. Borrowing and spending create more borrowing and spending...</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p><p style='text-align:both;'>Ultimately, the bubble will expand no longer. When new buyers can no longer borrow, prices stop rising. From ceasing to rise to starting to fall takes but a moment: nobody wants to hold assets that nobody wants to buy. This is the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minsky moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099, a term coined by Paul McCulley, formerly of the Pacific Investment Management Company. If left unchecked, the Minsky moment can become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinsky meltdown\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a spreading decline in asset values capable of producing a recession. Once the supply of \u00e2\u0080\u0098greater fools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has dried up, those who have borrowed in the expectation of further price rises will be forced to sell, the institutions who have lent to such institutions will also want their money back. That triggers the panic, the systemic crisis and the recession. The financial sector and the economy crash. The Minsky cycle is complete.</p><p style='text-align:both;'></p>",

In its place they advocate more holistic approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer.
